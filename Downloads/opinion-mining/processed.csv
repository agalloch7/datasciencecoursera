I am always having trouble connecting with Siri or with the new Geofencing.2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,Joe review,2.8.0,1,This needs to be fixed I can't use my $200 lights now.2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,Awesomegirlbhdhshega,2.8.0,2,"I have three lights that I've been using for a long time; they haven't been working at all with these past few updates. I make sure I keep everything up to date and the lights are still unresponsive. Aside from that, I loved them when they worked."2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,kevinguzmvn,2.8.0,1,"Can't use home app if the hue app is not updated. Got home from a trip and none of my lights turned on, neither could they be turned on through the hue app without first updating the lights. How the heck do you expect me to update if I can't even see where to place my stuff inside my home once I arrive from my trip. Mildly annoying but the more I think about it, the more annoying it is. My Sonos speakers can still work, even with an update pending. Why can't my lights?? I've spent so much money on these stupid lights, let me use them when I f***ing need it, DUH"2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,2plypat,2.8.0,1,"I've never done this before. I've never written a review, but I'm doing for you Philips. This is terrible. Someone should probably be fired for releasing this app."2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,R0binStar,2.8.0,1,"The first gen app was much better. It gave better control for not individual and grouped lights. So disappointed on this ""new"" version which makes many things much more complicated and time consuming _"2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,jcjungledj,2.8.0,1,Why remove functionality that obviously drew people to the system? This app is inferior to the 1st gen app.2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,Sweep11,2.8.0,1,Ever since I had to update the app it no longer connects regularly. I have to delete and reinstall it.  Don't update. It's garbage2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,Hkimble92,2.8.0,1,"The first gen app made it easy and fun to create new scenes and stored everything in a logical place. The new app requires you to meander through the entire non intuitive interface to accomplish anything, and yet it still seems to fall flat of the functionality of its predecessor. I sincerely hope they address these issues, because it seems clear that the other app will soon no longer be supported."2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,kaushikc,2.8.0,1,I had many problems. Cannot login and frequent sync error. All my settings keep getting erased randomly. Massive drain on the battery. Very slow to switch the lights on and off. It was good before but it is terrible for the first gen hue now. Updates are getting worse. People dont keep updating hardware for lights every year. Philips need to provide quality support fora reasonable period of time.2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,Itsmehere59,2.8.0,1,"Wow Philips. What a spectacular way to destroy a fantastic system. Seriously, who did your UAT and did they realise what they had to do. This screams of being tested by someone who does not use or understand your product. Terrible user interface and leaving out proven and popular functionality. Switch to supporting the first App which I have happily used for 20 months now and will go back to. I am available for UAT if you need someone who knows what they are doing. All I ask is that you don't let the same people lose on the hardware or you will ruin that too."2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,Machete Rabioso,2.8.0,1,I deinstalled after 3 days. Went back to the previous version. Geofencing don't know if its working or not. With the previous version you receive a notification when arriving and leaving. Couldn't find a way to group the lights with my custom scene. I tried to add all the lights under home and then they weren't available individually anymore... very confusing. Wouldn't upgrade to this version. Needs further work.2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,KJensen731,2.8.0,1,"This app is NOTHING compared to the first generation. I loved that app, it was simple, the setting were easier to use, I could set each light in a Photo Scene to the exact light recipe I needed/wanted... now everything I loved and enjoyed about Philips Hue & Friends is gone. Only reason why I still use this is because I have invested to much money not to. Thanks a lot Phillips for taking my money and leaving me with nothing but regret. I've have these lights since the day they hit the shelfs so I have. Wen there with you for every update and not once have I complained until you took away my first gen app."2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,Rafahell,2.8.0,1,"Awful app. Takes a life to send any command to the lights, crashs all the time. The lights are a totally waste os money.

I have to reset my color scheme every night because it resets all by itself to plain white light.  Also not very user friendly navigation within. Spent a lot of money on these lights, and the app needs to work for them to work properly. Fix your app."2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,KirstieBallance,2.8.0,5,Massively better than the first iteration. If I had one complaint it would be that the sensor schedule only allows for day/night so 6:30 in the morning on Monday behaves the same as Saturday... for a night light that's a wee bit annoying.2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,Musiccproducer,2.8.0,1,"I loved the first app, why did you guys downgrade! I went on your website on how to create scenes and it is no where to be found! Someone help! Look at all these negative reviews! Get on it Philips or I'm not recommending you to anyone!"2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,Alex355753,2.8.0,2,"Like the app. Easy to manipulate lighting . Very frustrating that my phone does not recognize the bridge from time to time . I e deleted and re downloaded the app multiple times , even powered off my bridge and still nothing! The developers need to fix this asap!"2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,scott-in-columbus,2.8.0,1,"Doesn't work half the time and it wants to update before I use it, so I have to just manually turn lights off 50% of the time."2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,mikeshafer,2.8.0,4,"The first Hue app was... ok. It did the job but the interface was so bad that third party apps came to the party. This one is way better so far. You can easily group lights into rooms and the interface to change lights is much smoother. I dock it one star because as I've had the new app for about fifteen minutes, I've had to run through the bridge update process three times which takes about two minutes each time. Hopefully this will get fixed soon. Alexa integration still works so I'm happy with that!"2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,TomKlaus,2.8.0,1,Veel betaald voor de Hue Lampen en dan zo'n waardeloze app! Hoe durven jullie Phillips! Jullie moeten je schamen! Hoe stel ik snel kleur en lichtsterkte in per lamp voor automatisch aangaan? Dit was eenvoudig te doen in de oude app. Waar is de alarm knop uit de oude app?

IOs is reporting a 50% of consumption and the app is always closed."2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,Naturals,2.8.0,1,"As soon as i updated the app, nothing ever works properly. Come on philips, wtf. It worked fine for 3 years until this update. Pissing me off."2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,JustBob4Now,2.8.0,1,"Terrible app. It might add a couple of useful things, but it strips too much functionality from the old app. What's worse, I have scheduled events created in the old app that can't be edited in the new one, and the old app won't run anymore. I'm sure Philips will tell me to default the bridge and set up all 20+ lights again. I regret ever buying into their ecosystem."2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,damahala,2.8.0,1,"Almost nothing is working. - You can't login to your account. - You can't add new discovered light to a room which means you can't control it!!"2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,DodoMgc,2.8.0,1,"It took ages to support the 2nd generation app on the iPad and this is completely unreliable. According to the iPad stats it consumed 41% of my battery in the last seven days despite being on the screen for a few minutes. Plus the widget continuously freezes and you have to delete it and make a new one. Useful features like timers disappeared from the 1st generation. Philips, you can do better than this!"2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,Mikeb71,2.8.0,1,"Seems that the remote access feature is broken via the app. If I log into the Hue webpage and try to control my lights it works. Additionally, if I go into Apple's Home app I can happily control my lights while away from home, however, in the Hue app I just get the ""No Hue connection"". _"2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,m_diggity,2.8.0,1,"I can't have a scene that controls lights across multiple rooms ? The whole system is unresponsive now. I was happy with what we had. This upgrade has caused a complete mess. Routines is useless.

Please update soon!"2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,Colombi9,2.8.0,4,Not sure why all the negative reviews for the app. Works just fine for me. There are other good apps too but I use this one everyday.

Does anyone at Philips now what is going???"2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,Enick2002,2.8.0,1,In the suggested apps it is nearly impossible to close the window with the app displayed to return back to the menu. Consider how many people have hue lights I am shocked how terrible the app is. The way you could color pick all your lights to an image is nearly impossible. It does it by room.2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,patsfan32,2.8.0,1,You can't share your settings with someone else in your house2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,Tmckaz,2.8.0,1,"I hung on to the first version for as long as I could and earlier this week it stopped opening on my phone so I was forced to move to the ""upgrade"" - all of the intuitive functionality is gone and the app has reduced the functionality of the lights.

Do I have to re-assign dimmers and buttons to these new scenes?Re-installed almost year after my previous review (above) and holy moly. Are you kidding me? Who is the developer team on this project? Can I please come work there for a year or so and project manage this mess?Every other Hue app can find my bridge, but this one can't and I have to manually enter the IP address. Strike one.Creating scenes. Well, it's INSANE that the scenes from the previous app aren't supported here. Insane. But, ok. Let's give this one a try. Create a scene. Let's use a photo like in old app. Wait. You can't set individual lights to specific colors? You can only dim the lights and deal with whatever color the app RANDOMLY assigns to the bulb? YOU.  HAVE. TO. BE. KIDDING ME. Strike two. Sweet Jesus. Philips. Get. It. Together."2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,HelmetHair,2.8.0,1,"This application is a huge disappointment. No support for sunset/sunrise times and the requirement of a Hue account to use Homekit is abusrd. The fact of the matter is I suggest to users to use Hue Pro on an Android device. This app is a joke. I usually never award just one star but this is one case the application deserves it. We're not talking about an indie developer here, rather a commerical entity who can't be bothered to produce decent software to compliment their hardware."2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,Danielntlions,2.8.0,2,"Why would you remove the Timer feature? It makes no sense to do so. Please add it back!If you're forcing us to move to the new app because you won't support Gen 1, then please add useful features."2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,Hue Fanatic,2.8.0,1,Incredibly poor decision for the product team to have replaced the old app and essentially restrict users from using it. This 2.0 version seems to be written without any understanding of how the typical user would use it.  Setting timers and scenes and creating any real automation just not considered well here.  Investment would have been better focused on making the old app more usable and adding features rather than redesigning UX and calling that innovation.  Highly encourage the product team to reconsider.2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,katolotus,2.8.0,1,Moving to this version was a nightmare from the perfectly working previous version. Nothing transfers and new app set up is far from user friendly. Let's hope whoever design and whoever sign off this 'downgrade' doesn't get to go anywhere near the next version. Complete cluster f*ck _2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,MrsBA,2.8.0,1,"Bought a couple more Hue bulbs, to switch my bedroom from white to color.  Had to download new app to add them. Ugh!  Now no more real (animated scenes).  Had to purchase rainstorm and now that scene that I paid for has LESS OPTIONS?!?   Put my original two white bulbs. Had to delete and re- DL app to have the old lights recognized.  Now WHERE'S the storm scene I just paid for????So much trouble using this app.   Makes me feel like a disconnected idiot.  YUCK!  Fix this quick, or bring back the old app. I deleted my old app... going to go see if its still available to me.  Very frustrating!"2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,Alex3775,2.8.0,1,This app is terrible. The only good thing about this app is the fact that the released it as a new app instead of an update so you can still use the old one.2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,Winnj1987,2.8.0,1,Seriously... give an option to decline an update or push it out!!!

What's wrong with philips?2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,rcmoot,2.8.0,1,"This may literally be the worst update I have ever received for an app. If I had not already invested so much money in the bulbs I would completely abandon the platform.

Didn't think it could get worse than the original app but Philips sure has proven me wrong!2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,AdamHoward1,2.8.0,5,Not experienced any issues.

Used with both Hue bulbs and light switches2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,~Ej~,2.8.0,2,"The 1st gen app is much better, the gen 2 app is missing a lot of the original features. 1 I feel the best bit about the 1st gen app needs to be added to this version which is the random setting for lights to randomly come on either side of a specific time. (Also being able to switch off a light from widgets. Was better on 1st gen hence why I haven't deleted the app. Philips have gone backwards on improving its app).

They have all really stunk."2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,jasonchristopher76,2.8.0,1,"The decision to discontinue support for the gen 1 app over the train wreck app that is gen 2 is beyond disappointing. With each ""improvement"" the app has gotten worse And worse. Congrats Phillips. I was contemplating replacing my gen 1 bulbs with gen 3. But after this announcement, I will be throwing them away and researching alternatives. Look at the rating and reviews for this app. Clearly it has issues and your development team should be fired. LISTEN TO YOUR CUSTOMERS"2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,Gekkonaut,2.8.0,1,"The first app was clumsy but fulfilled most people's use case. Now it's gone. This version only allows you to set scenes per room, which makes zero sense unless you're living in a studio apartment."2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,TheAsaMan,2.8.0,2,"The previous app, for me, was much much better... now it no longer works after the LAST update.  It will not launch!  So it appears I am stuck with this version.  Unless I erase 7 scenes I have created."2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,Jahabah,2.8.0,1,"I've been using this app with Hue color bulbs for over a year now. The bulbs themselves and the colors they can produce are wonderful. I always forced to update the app whenever a new app is available the after the update is released. This means that when I we are ready to go to bed and dim the lights, I'm forced to wait until the update completes before I'm able to control them. It is a great inconvenience when trying to get to sleep. Meanwhile I lay in bed with the lights on full brightness. This has remained unchanged since app release. As far as I know this is an issue for iOS. I'm not sure if Android users have experienced this. As soon as this is fixed I will upgrade my rating to four stars and write a proper review."2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,Hue enthusiast no more,2.8.0,1,The latest update has screwed up everything. No rooms work no scenes work bulbs are going on and off randomly.  There was no option not to update it comes up and forces you to update.  This was not tested and has made a mess of all the setups I have done.  I have ten rooms and 54 lights.  It is really unprofessional to force this on people and break people's setups and features.2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,Zypher23,2.8.0,1,"This second gen app is such a disappointment. I finally received notice that the first app no longer was going to be supported. So I switched over all my alarms to the new ""routines"". Well, low and behold, I just woke up and my lights were NOT on despite my wake up being set to turn on >30min ago. I checked my network and it's working, I checked Fing and it sees my Hue Bridge. I checked my app and I was able to manually turn on my lights. So what gives? Having the light turn on is critical to my routine. On top of all this, it doesn't even remember my last theme setting on my lights and keeps reverting to ""relax"" mode if I turn one on and off. I may have to go back to the unsupported app. Why make a new app and break every feature that made the old one great? And WHY is there even a second app? Why couldn't the first one just be updated or at least give the second a working import setting for the alarms. This is such BS! Make this thing work!!!"2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,cryptographrix,2.8.0,1,"Hue intentionally crashed their original app to try to get users over to this one.This app is actually horrible, and since it's now obvious that we can't trust the Hue iOS developers not to abandon their user base, our lighting systems are now at the behest of their shifting industry.Wasn't the promise of LED light to have lights that lasted longer and were better at being controlled?This forced update just broke that promise for Hue."2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,Yas9in,2.8.0,2,"I'm afraid this app is just not reliable enough. After a day or two it will lose the bridge and there is literally no way of reconnecting. I was skeptical of other reviews describing this problem but I'm afraid it's true.

You can set one ""routine"" to turn the lights on, and a second routine to turn them off. But if you turn the lights off before the second routine's time, that routine will turn your lights on at its set time.

I used to just hit one button for a 10-minute timer to fade the lights out as I go to sleep. Now I have to sift through a ton of screens, pick the fade out option, and then literally set a time (which is always now) to fade the lights out. I would think the time would not be required.  It's kind of self-explanatory - if I want to go to bed, I don't want to have to input what time I'm going to want the lights to fade out. I want them to start fading NOW!

I purchased these lights so that I could set up automated schedules for on and off times for when I am away ( so that it appears someone is home). This is possible, but not well designed. You must create a unique routine for every time that you want to switch a light (or grouping of lights) on or off. Other apps allow you to set on and off times in the same routine. I've even used one that let you add intervals. So you could have your downstairs lights turn on at 5:00pm then off at 7:00 pm then on again at 8:30pm and off again at 11:20pm. I like that I was able to control both on and off as well as doing multiple on/offs in a single routine. The other feature that I really liked on other apps is the ability to add a random amount of time to my scheduled in/off times set in my routine. So I might have my off time set for 11:00 but I also have the ""randomize"" feature set on with a value of 30 minutes. This would add a random amount of time (between 0 and 30 minutes) to my scheduled 'off' time. So on the first day it might add 12 minutes and turn the lights off at 11:12pm. Then the next day it would add 25 minutes and turn the lights off at 11:25pm. This allows you to set up less sets of routines by making them variable. So even though I may only have one routine for weekends, the lights would go on and off at different times (relative to the specific times that I had set). It's a small thing, but I feel it is important. The last item that I would address is that periodically the app won't recognize that I'm home and connected to my home wifi signal. In these cases it still connects me, but assumes I'm accessing the system remotely. The app still works to turn lights on and off, but there is a delay. I'm not sure why this happens. So far it seems random as I haven't been able to isolate a pattern. All that being said, that app does control my lights.

If you have one set of Hue lights in a room, then fantastic, it will work well for you, but I have 4 Hue GU10 spotlights in the lounge ceiling and 2 E27 bulbs in the lamps either side of the lounge. These are set up as two rooms (lamps & lounge), because otherwise they cannot be controlled individually as 2 groups and the 'scenes' will be applied to all of the bulbs and spotlights. Of an evening when I'm relaxing I don't want the ceiling spotlights on, just the lamps. To do this you have to set them up as different rooms!!!!This is a problem, because the dimmer switch will only control one room (although it has 5 settings, these settings will only apply 5 scenes to 1 room!!!!). The reason I have given two stars is because of this limitation and because Philips tell me that the App programs the dimmer!!! The other reason I have given 2 stars is that Philips are proud that they have opened up the App to third parties to develop their own Apps which will allow functions that are not available through the official Philips App. Some may see this as a positive, but essentially this means that you are likely going to have to pay a third party for an App, that gives you more control. Fair enough as Apps cost money to develop, but Philips, poor show really, instead of taking ownership of a poor control App for the Hue, they are passing the buck to third parties. Of course this then means that when you call Philips Hue Customer Services, they will simply say, sorry we do not provide support for issues with third party Apps!!!Cynical, maybe.

Try to work the Hue app for two locations, two homes or work and home - the software can't deal with it. I set up Hue at one home, traveled 1000 miles to another and set up hue there on a Sunday (Hue support was closed).

Pre-purchse research on the Philips Hue website left us thoroughly confused about what to order, so I drove to Best Buy where I fiound an in-store display even more confusing than Hue website. I found an exceptionally sharp and knowledgeable Best Buy sales associate, but he admitted to being just as confused as I was regarding which Hue lights and accessories are Generation 2 vs Generation 3, the differences between some of the lights and how any of that related to HomeKit compatibility. I concluded that the only way to understand the product line was to buy a small selection of the bulbs and system components and do some trial and error. That meant leaving Best But with a fraction of the Hue lights I'd hoped to deploy... but it STILL added up to more than $300.Setup JUST DOESN'T WORK. The Hue iOS app ""sees"" the bridge, but pressing the bridge's button when instructed does abosolutely nothing at all; I never got past that so I've never had any opportunity to do the (supposedly) required setup. However HomeKit ""sees"" the Hue Brige and 2 of my 5 Hue bulbs... so WHY do I need the Hue software? And what is the ryhme or reason of some bulbs showing up in HomeKit and some not? And for the bulds that I CAN control with HomeKit why can I only get on/off and dimmer? What happened to colour temperature? Is it even a feature of the bulds I bought? Seems to be, but the packaging isn't clear and it's difficult to determine which of the bulbs I ended up with match specs on the Hue website.Two unpleasant hours later I've thrown the whole lot in a bag and will return everything to Best Buy. $320 is a bloody high price to pay to for 5 lightbulbs and a couple switches. Even if there IS some way to get this junk working (which I doubt--I suspect it's just a bad, bug-ridden product) I'm NOT interested in paying this much for a product that makes me look and feel stupid. I'm actually quite confident that I'm NOT particularly stupid... but I suspect the product managers and designers of this product line (or at least the Hue app) probably ARE.

I was looking forward to seeing a much larger set of scenes without having to scroll so much. Very poor use of the iPad area.One quibble: the patch notes say you can add 'multiple scenes' to a HomeKit scene, but there seems to be no way to do this in either Home or the Hue app. Did they mean multiple rooms?

That leaves us having to mess around with multiple apps to achieve even a simple thing like turning on lights at sunset. Then, with multiple apps, you have to figure out which apps work with HomeKit (if you're using that), along with trying to keep your Hue bridge cleaned up after these other apps load their own scenes and whatnot onto the bridge. Dear Phillips; in case you haven't noticed the new standard for home lighting is being chosen by consumers right now. And history should tell you that consumers are not necessarily going to push the market to the best technology.  Consumers want a complete solution without having to piecemeal together a bunch of different hardware and apps to accomplish different tasks. What can you do with the Phillips Hue App1. Schedule light(s) to turn on and offWhat can't you do1. Turn on and off lights based on changing criteria like sunrise or sunset2. Create lighting effects to continuously change,fade,brighten individual or groups of lights3. Create groups of lights - at least not in the latest app4. Sync the lights to music5. And so forth......Come on Phillips, if you really want to make some money with this product do two simple things:1.  Make your application the go to app for anything and everything you could possibly accomplish with these lights 2.  Create an addressable adapter for regular non-Hue bulbs.

If I could get my money back and go with another brand, I would gladly scrap the Hue platform altogether, as is is completely unreliable. The concept was great and it used to work well, but between one of the worst UIs I have ever seen, and how incredibly unreliable this system is, I would never recommend it to another person.

The biggest, and most obvious mistake the developers made was to eliminate the ability to create scenes that can control lights in multiple rooms or in the entire home. When I first bought the Hue system a friend told me that the new Hue app couldn't control lights in multiple rooms at the same time. I looked quizzically at him and said, ""Naw, I don't believe it.  That capability is so basic that no-one would eliminate that.""  Dang if it isn't true though!For those using this 2nd gen Hue app who want to create scenes with lights in multiple rooms (or the entire house), I suggest using Apple's stock Home (HomeKit) app to create the scenes. It works fine... and the scenes will work with Siri!This is not to say the 2nd gen Hue app doesn't need to be improved. We can ""get by"" this way, but most of the criticisms in the app reviews are valid. That said, for me, not even the 1st gen Hue app can do what I want to do with my lights. Not only do I want to create static scenes of a certain brightness and color, but I want scenes that can fade in and out, and that can change color and brightness gradually. The most obvious use for this is for a movie scene where the lights slowly dim. Also, I want the ability to create my own ""animations"" for my lights. For this I am forced to look to 3rd party apps. After testing over 21 different Hue apps, the best one I've found so far that can do all this is called Hue Lights. It has a great widget and Apple Watch support too. The only thing it can't do is create scenes that can be used with Siri, but I hear that capability will be in the app early next year. Once that's there it will probably be the primary app I use with Hue. Lastly, I have a feature request for Hue's motion sensor... is it possible to add a ""tripwire"" function where the lights do one thing when motion is detected the first time, and the second time motion is detected the lights do something else? One of the problems I'm having is the lights turning off while I am reading. I read for hours at a stretch and really don't move much while reading, so a timer doesn't work. Also using a motion sensor in the bedroom is impossible. It detects motion when you toss and turn in sleep and turns on the lights every time! By placing the motion sensor so that it has a narrow field of view, and with a tripwire function, we could use a motion detector in the bedroom to turn on the lights when we walk in and turn off the lights when we walk out. This would save energy too. Another motion sensor feature i would like is the ability to utilize its light level and temperature sensors to control my lights. The sensors are there, why not use them? Oh, and HomeKit compatibility would be nice too and would make the motion sensor much more useful. That's about it. Hue is a great product and getting better every year. I hope some of this review was helpful."2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,Grant Russell,2.6.0,5,Philips Hue is an excellent product.

Sometimes Siri will work and the app and widgets won't, other times it's the other way around. It's getting close to unusable. They'd better step up their game before competitors overtake them. The bar keeps getting lower...Original:The new app fails in several ways. The biggest failing is the inability to assign bulbs to more than one ""room"". The quotes are important, since you might want to define a room as the whole house, or several physical rooms. Since a bulb can only be in one ""room"" in the app, you're out of luck if you want scenes that apply to a single room *and* scenes that are for larger areas in the house (like, say, a scene for a living room night light and a scene for watching TV that affects lights in the living room and nearby dining room). Technically you could define a single room for all the bulbs and then create a ton of scenes, but it's awkward and you'll still run into a problem if you want to turn on lights in two separate physical rooms independently.The other issue is that there's no good way to import scenes and settings from the old app. You have to activate a scene in the old app, then use the add scene button. You need to do this for each scene, and again you're out of luck if you want to copy a scene spanning rooms.I also noticed the app had a hard time connecting to certain lights. They'd become unresponsive for a while, sometimes requiring restarting the app.All in all, this app is an attempt to streamline the interface, but in doing so makes the app less usable. Hopefully this gets addressed in future updates.For now I'd recommend staying on the gen 1 app until lights are allowed to span rooms and the connectivity to the lights gets a little more stable."2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,RobertInLA,2.6.0,1,"Do NOT download this app onto your iPad if you already have it running on your iPhone.I installed it and happily saw all my scenes had copied over from the Bridge. I started to create a new widget on the iPad and after setting up the 2nd item suddenly the same scene had been duplicated several times. Then a different scene appeared to be duplicated.The screwed up settings propagated back to my iPhone and probably they are totally wrecked on the Bridge as well. UPDATE: after mucking about it seems at least 4 scenes were corrupted and all assigned one name and a different image/color scheme. Deleting one crashed the app but seems to have cleared them from Bridge.Also the dashboard widget used to show two lines of items (8), now it only shows 4 with the next row revealing only the tops of the icons. Clicking Show More on the widget does nothing.This app update is a DISASTER. Everything I do in it screws up more of my scenes. Seriously how did this get released?"2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,Jewel Engineering,2.6.0,1,Right now I can't control my lights at all because the app won't let me do anything until I install an update.

Dies h_tte gleich nach dem groen Update auf die neue Gen.2 App passieren mssen. Soweit funktioniert alles, jedoch l_sst die Grafik an einigen Stellen zu wnschen brig. Die original Symbole von Philips (z.B gedimmt oder Nachtlicht) sehen sehr verpixelt aus, hier wurden die Symbole in geringer Aufl_sung der iPhone App genommen. Aber naja, damit kann man leben.2. 3D TOUCH FUNKTION: wurde endlich eingefgt, jedoch ohne die M_glichkeit, hier eine spezielle Reihenfolge festzulegen - unabh_ngig von den Widgets. Bei den Widgets werden mir 10 Symbole angezeigt, bei 3D Touch nur die ersten 5. Klar, es es weniger Platz vorhanden, dennoch w_re es wnschenswert, die 3D Touch Shortcuts unabh_ngig von den Widgets festzulegen.So h_tte man mehr M_glichkeiten die Szenen ohne App zu _ndern. Schade - hier wurde nur halbherzig eine l_ngst berf_llige Funktion nachgereicht. 3. INDIVIDUELLE SZENEN BEARBEITEN: endlich, die wohl wichtigste neue Funktion. Jetzt kann man direkt eigene Szenen bearbeiten, ohne jedes Mal eine neue anzulegen um danach Widgets, Schalter usw. manuell zu aktualisieren. Dennoch sollte Philips weiter an der Verbesserung des Systems arbeiten. Es gibt noch viele Sachen, die einfach zu benutzerunfreundlich sind oder nicht richtig funktionieren. Statt 1 Stern gibt es nun 3. Wenn nun auch der Rest noch bearbeitet wird, wird auch der Rest der Community die App wieder besser bewerten.Hier noch der Rest aus der alten Rezension:- Ortungsfunktion: mal funktioniert es, mal nicht. Auerdem w_re ein gewisser Radius wnschenswert, wie in der alten App. WAS ICH NICHT VERSTEHE: Warum kann die App, trotz der HomeKit Integration nicht mit weiteren Bewohnern umgehen? Immer wenn ich das Haus verlasse, sitzt meine Frau im dunklen. K_nnen die App Entwickler von Philips nicht so weit denken? Oder ist das System ausschlielich fr Singles konzipiert?! Unverst_ndlich fr mich. - Hue Switch: bitte mehr als 2 R_ume erm_glichen, wenn ich im Flur das Haus verlasse, m_chte ich alles ausschalten, nicht nur 2 R_ume. ( Wenn ich ""Haus"" ausw_hle, kann ich beim reinkommen nicht nur ""Flur"" anmachen) Widgets: bitte Synchronisation erm_glichen. Ich muss bei 3 Ger_ten immer manuell auf allen Ger_ten das gleiche einstellen/ aktualisieren. Sehr mhsam wenn man ein ganzes Haus voller Lampen hat. Fr das Geld was ihr fr die Hardware verlangt, muss die Software einfach auf dem Stand der Zeit sein und auch so funktionieren wie es soll. Leider ist es immer noch so, dass Drittanbieterl_sungen deutlich effektiver und individueller arbeiten. Ich habe das Gefhl, je mehr Lampen ich habe, desto schwieriger wird die Verwaltung.

I had resigned to try the app and rationalized that I did not need all the different lighting scenes and was going to be happy with just my one favorite for each room and the outside lighting. What really made me upset was when I had programmed the lighting for a room only to have the round light switches only give you Hue choices and if you happen to choose one, it erases your program and replaces it with the switch program. Hue needs to DUMP this app and stay with the first app.  I see no redeeming value with this new Hue2 app. Really .... do not waste your time with this new app. Shame on Phillips Hue for bringing out this horrible app version.

For six months During a room by room upgrade from conventional lights to Hue LEDs I used one bridge. As time progressed I have now a need to add the second. Using iConnectHue as my preferred app, I took good advise from Stefan Goehler and started the process of adding lights to the Hue bridges via the Hue app, rather than start from iConnectHue. Things went well for a while. The Phillips app connected to both bridges. I was able to search for the lights; Adding ground floor & first floor lights to each bridge, controllers and all. I was quite impressed. My frustration came about when two lights in separate rooms were not responding. I tried in vein to add the serial numbers, I even stood on a set of steps offering the bridge to the LED, multiple times, but with no success. In the ongoing process of trying to discover 2 out of 63 LEDs, this app has prevented me from switching between bridges, meaning I have rooms created on both bridges, lights need to be assigned, however the app will not allow me to go backwards to select another option, or cancel the present action. I wish I hadn't bothered with the LEDs, there's just no alignment of hardware to software in the quality stakes.

Dus je komt thuis, de lichten gaan weliswaar aan, maar die ga je allemaal __n voor __n weer aanpassen.Philips lijkt voor je te denken. Dus ook hebben ze de routines aangepast.

I have a couple rooms that have matching pendants or lamps and I can no longer get those to be the same color. I'm forced to use the pre-set designs which are nice but don't necessarily fit my personal style. The option to set a routine to wake-up with the lights fading in is a complete flop! Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt! The worst part is, only one bright light comes on. In the original version my nice dim lights would come on so I could wake up peacefully, not with a bright light in my face. I appreciate that you are trying to improve but so many wonderful features from previous programs have been eliminated. Don't force an upgrade if you don't have the wrinkles ironed out. I preferred the previous version and if I don't see an update in the near future I will go back to my traditional lightbulbs and IKEA dimmers that are guaranteed to suit my personal desire on demand!

Pourquoi seulement des routines ?2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,ThomasSerio,2.4.0,1,"Update: The app has taken to either not connecting to the hub (second gen) at all, or taking 30 seconds to connect every time the app opens.  Sometimes Siri will work and the app and widgets won't, other times it's the other way around. It's getting close to unusable. They'd better step up their game before competitors overtake them. The bar keeps getting lower...Original:The new app fails in several ways. The biggest failing is the inability to assign bulbs to more than one ""room"". The quotes are important, since you might want to define a room as the whole house, or several physical rooms. Since a bulb can only be in one ""room"" in the app, you're out of luck if you want scenes that apply to a single room *and* scenes that are for larger areas in the house (like, say, a scene for a living room night light and a scene for watching TV that affects lights in the living room and nearby dining room). Technically you could define a single room for all the bulbs and then create a ton of scenes, but it's awkward and you'll still run into a problem if you want to turn on lights in two separate physical rooms independently.The other issue is that there's no good way to import scenes and settings from the old app. You have to activate a scene in the old app, then use the add scene button. You need to do this for each scene, and again you're out of luck if you want to copy a scene spanning rooms.I also noticed the app had a hard time connecting to certain lights. They'd become unresponsive for a while, sometimes requiring restarting the app.All in all, this app is an attempt to streamline the interface, but in doing so makes the app less usable. Hopefully this gets addressed in future updates.For now I'd recommend staying on the gen 1 app until lights are allowed to span rooms and the connectivity to the lights gets a little more stable."2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,spiders georg,2.4.0,2,won't stay paired with Siri no matter what.

Everything had easily found labels and it was obvious how to navigate and set scenes/lights/colors/timers/ect without having to google how-to videos just to find your way around. It took me three months to actually delve in to figure this app out and I only did it because they stopped properly supporting the old app on the apple watch (which was half the reason I got the apple watch, mind you). There are, of course, pros and cons to this new app once you get past the ridiculous learning curve.Pros:-When you set a scene with one light on and one light off it actually turns the light off instead of just not having it react. This was an issue I found with the other app that I was glad they addressed.-There is seemingly no limit on how many widgets you can have. Or at least, it's got a higher limit. I don't know if this is because of ios10 or because Philips stopped limiting it but I'm up to 13 scene widget (the limit on the other was 10) and it's still letting me add.-If you have an apple watch, the watch not only has as complication for Hue but the app actually loads up faster now on the watch. No more 30-60 second lag (most of the time) waiting for the thing to load up.Cons:-Setting up routines is annoyingly complicated. If I want to set the light up so that my elderly father (who still works) can come out to the living room with the lights on and then have them turn off after 30 minutes I have to first set up a routine to turn them on then a routine to turn them on. The old app let me set my own parameters with just one save. This seemed like an unnecessary complication.-I tend to use color picker rather than picking colors from a picture but the fact that you cannot actually self-select a picture color is frustrating when you try to do it. This could've been done much more skillfully than it was-I cannot for the life of me figure out how to edit a scene once I've created it. Maybe I've just not found the method yet, maybe it's not there. If it's not there than fixing that would be excellent so you don't have to create a whole new scene just to tweak it. If it is possible then for godsake make it obvious."2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,Hazzabijan,2.4.0,3,"Firstly the UI looks a lot better than before except now it's less functional, I can't make my own scenes (by colour) or just pick the colour of the room, these were basics which were already in the original app, why can't I make a scene using colour sliders like before? The off widget doesn't even work, I was expecting more feature to be integrated such as lights changing to music or visuals like other 3rd party apps offer, this should all be included in the price of hue bulbs they are very expensive and I must say the lights are amazing but the app needs work if you want people to adopt this technology for the price of the bulbs the app offers insufficient functionality even when compared to the last generation app also I assume your aware and are working on the next generation of hue lights but the blues, greens and yellows aren't very vibrant and need to be stronger next time.

However, a couple of big fails here I am sure they anticipated people complaining about. #1: room based control. So now a scene can only control lights assigned to a specific room. See point #2. #2: No easy way to port over my gen 1 scenes. Even if I did as they recommend, use gen 1 to activate scene and they save current set up in gen 2, most of my scenes won't fully work because of point #1. My living room is connected to my dining room, hallway and loft. #3: Selecting lights based off a picture and being able to move the points around and group them is gone. That was the best feature gen 1 had. It was the one cool that I showed everyone as a brand enthusiast. It was so intuitive, easy and fast. Now, it's random and clunky to adjust if you want to change individual lights after starting with a picture.

I can't create my own scene to control certain sets of lights within that room or groups of lights within my house. Looking at other reviews this feature was available in previous versions of the app. Why remove this, you have limited your products potential though your own app? You need the ability the have quick link buttons to the routines or scenes(if they were not so limiting) on the homepage so I didn't have to go through a couple of screens to enable them. Create a widget so they are accessible from the locked screen of your phone. Essentially the usability is very poor.Fade, can I choose my own colours to fade in and out of? No of course not. Your website says turn on your imagination, perhaps I want to wake up to my lights fading from green to red, why are you limiting me!

Also all default scenes are recreated for each room you add, so the bridge gets full up with duplicate scenes, all named the same but all attached to different rooms, on the plus side, really like the shuffle feature, a bit more work and this will be a great app, look forward to your next update."2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,Im Card Claudia,2.3.0,4,"Was ich noch vermisse, dass der Sonnenuntergang auf Tastendruck aktiviert werden kann und zwar wenn man im Bett ist.

And we're left with no import function so if you want to use only this app, get ready to manually recreate all your previous setting/scenes. There are a few improvements, like the addition of rooms, but the benefits are outweighed by the lost functionality. Case in point, everything only functions by room instead of allowing the option to use certain bulbs from different rooms (like turning off the lights in one room and simultaneously turning the lights on in another or turning on the lights in more than one location.)  The emphasis on photo-based scenes still does not have the ability to choose specific bulb color and grouping is still not possible (so we are left with random colors.) Plus, in case you want to have multiple bulbs in one room with the same color, good luck getting all of them to match correctly.  We've had the new app for some time, and Philips has failed to explain the purpose of using it instead of improving the original one (all we get is a Twitter handle saying they'll pass along info to their development team.)

Also all default scenes are recreated for each room you add, so the bridge gets full up with duplicate scenes, all named the same but all attached to different rooms, on the plus side, really like the shuffle feature, a bit more work and this will be a great app, look forward to your next update."2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,tahorst,2.3.0,1,"Strzt h_ufig ab, ist unbersichtlich, endlos verschachtelt und berdesigned. Das machen einige Fremdanbieter besser.Und wieso kann ich nicht R_ume gruppieren?

Configuring a Philips dimmer switch or tap switch to control just one light is impossible now. You can't even assign scenes to tap buttons. What were they thinking?As others have already said. This app is one step forward and two steps back.1. Scenes have been dumbed down to the point that they are utterly useless. It's almost laughable. There is no way to actually customize or edit any scene short from hitting a randomize button. I was hoping that Philips would actually try and fix the scene editing interface rathen than just decapitating it.2. While room grouping is a welcome change, there is still no concept of grouping lights together as one logical unit (zone?). So if you have any rooms with multiple light fixtures that have multiple lights, good luck to you. You can turn a room on and off, but if you want a scene where some light fixtures are on and some are off or at different levels of itensity with different color, no go.3. Also, there is no way to create a scene that sets lights for multiple rooms. So if you have a relatively open floor plan and you want to configure your lights to dim down an adjacent room to watch a movie in the living area, no go.4. It is unclear if the Home & Away feature actually works with multiple users.This app might work well for customers that have bought a starter kit to play with the lights but it doesn't serve anyone that actually made a considerable investment in installing hue lights in an entire house."2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,Brenton07,2.3.0,2,"There are a lot of things I really appreciate about the new app once I started understanding the new setup. However, the biggest thing making this a two star review and not 3 1/2 or 4 is I can't make custom scenes for Hue Tap.

I experienced none of these. Connected to the bridge on the first time (and on multiple devices), scanned for and detected all lights save one (had to follow the in-app directions and put in the bulb's serial number - a very minor setback), and we've had loads of fun playing with ""Scenes"". While the general complaints about the app being mildly un-intuitive, sitting on the couch drinking a beer gave me the patience to ""discover"" all of its capabilities. It's deep - and that's not easy. The one complaint I share (and therefore the reason I knocked off a star) was that you cannot apply Scenes to more than one room. Seems like an overlooked feature, but no big deal really. Also, the ""Go to sleep"" routine is kind of a mess - if you have a scene applied, the app slowly puts the lights into general mode (i.e., bright!) and then starts the ""Go to sleep"" routine. That's not how I would have programmed it, but this is very minor to me. The ""Wake up"" routines were far more important and work as expected (though again, if a Scene is applied to the room/lights, the routine ignores that - this is probably good for waking up). One reviewer suggested a login, and I agree with that. But, overall, this is everything I expected and while it takes a modicum of brain power to figure out, for me, that was half the fun.

No need for me to rehash them all. I will like to address one issue that's important to me: poor Routine execution. The app gives the ability for users to setup automatic Routines that trigger at specified times. The problem: there is aways a number of Philip Hue lights that are not triggered by the Routine. These lights are programmed to be triggered, plus they are not out of range from the Hue Bridge and they are powered on during the triggered Routine, but due to bugs random lights are not following the Routine and the color stays unchanged or changes to a default white, which is not part of the Routine. This bug voids the ingenuity of having automotive Routines. I have to manually select the scene to get the remaining lights to change color. Pathetic excuse for a native app from Philips. Same could be said for the first gen app they gave up on. Why did I invest in these lavishly priced lights when clearly Philips has invested so little? Their buggy app should give potential consumers plenty of reasons to consider taking their money elsewhere. Although I love what connected lighting can do, I absolutely do not recommend purchasing Philips Hue products. I own 7 Blooms, 4 color RB30 spotlights, 7 color A19s, 2 Hue Tabs, and a Siri equipped Bridge, which I have amassed slowly over a couple years. Huge investment.

And we're left with no import function so if you want to use only this app, get ready to manually recreate all your previous setting/scenes. There are a few improvements, like the addition of rooms, but the benefits are outweighed by the lost functionality. Case in point, everything only functions by room instead of allowing the option to use certain bulbs from different rooms (like turning off the lights in one room and simultaneously turning the lights on in another or turning on the lights in more than one location.)  The emphasis on photo-based scenes still does not have the ability to choose specific bulb color and grouping is still not possible (so we are left with random colors.) Plus, in case you want to have multiple bulbs in one room with the same color, good luck getting all of them to match correctly.  We've had the new app for some time, and Philips has failed to explain the purpose of using it instead of improving the original one (all we get is a Twitter handle saying they'll pass along info to their development team.)

How come Phillips managed to make so difficult something so simple (other apps do it better on their own system). It's not intuitive, there is a lot to figure out in order to make it work. It might be prettier than the previous version but it is worst to use. This is the kind of things that makes me regret that I bought this system. Come Phillips, step it up, you can do better! How about making smart and consumer-friendly products?"2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,matwoj,2.2.0,4,"I have 14 Hue devices (mix of bulbs and light strips) and several Philips wireless wall switches, and I much prefer this new application. You can finally manage different rooms, creating new schemes is much improved, and finally for the hue color bulbs, you can finally also pick white temperature (although I wish it was providing numeric values, like 3000K or 4505 K and so on). Configuring wall switches through the app is also very nice.  I use the app every day, and so far it works pretty much without any issues. Of course this app can be improved, like having iPad version, or being able to *easily* set up timers for turing the light off (like delayed turn off in 5 minutes) without playing with schedules. It takes time to learn how to use this app, which can be frustrating for beginners but once you know how everything works, it's actually OK. However, I miss the ability to set up colors for multiple bulbs the way it was done with the old app. Honesly, I'm happy with this app but of course I hope there will be future updates with even more features.

However, I can no longer achieve my very simple scenario of setting certain lighting conditions while watching a movie. This has to do with a combination of the Rooms concept, how you create/apply a Scene, and limitations with Routines.My kitchen, dinning room, and living room are all separate Rooms, but in the physical world light from one influences lighting in another. In the old app, I had a scene that turned off light in all rooms except for a gentle blue light strip near my TV. In the new app, I need to set scenes on a room by room basis, meaning I now need to do 9 taps to achieve what I could previously do in 1. The new app does have Routines, which modify scenes across multiple rooms at once. This sounds perfect for what I want to do, but it has a critical failingyou can only make time-based routines. I don't watch a movie the same time or day of the week, I need to trigger the routine manually without it randomly running at some time I'm forced to set.Having manually-triggered routines that have no element of time would make this a 4 star app for me.

Sometimes the bulbs in a room will list but not always it seems. A couple times they flashed and disappeared when I flipped to that screen. The ability to take a picture to create a scene will only allow shuffle and moving/zooming around on a picture to adjust colors shown to formulate from and not individual picking of which lights are which colors. There used to be little pins you could move around on the picture that were numbered based on which bulb they were. Now it seems to formulate its own mix based on the picture and what parts of the picture you center on. Shuffle does not change much at all most times. Maybe change with bulb has its already formulated color choices? Guessing but that's what it seemed like. Unsure if I like this change. Would be cool if it allowed the ability to do both ways depending on mood choice. It also does not allow you to import scenes you've already created in their old app which I find disappointing. Luckily I did not create too many yet. Granted this can be remedied by selecting the scene in the old app and then just going to the bulbs section in the new one and simply save the current settings in a new scene (hit + and name it). It will take time but it's doable. You just won't have the picture with it if it was created with one originally. Another bug is that not all created scenes are syncing with HomeKit even after trying to do the ""resync home"" option it offers. I have not tried any geofencing that many are saying is buggy or any of the timers to see if they work. On the plus side the layout of the new app is cool once you figure it all out. It is appealing to use. Took me a few minutes to figure where to press and go to do what. I think the scene creation process of by pictures and by chosen colors (currently done by individually tinkering with each bulb and then saving settings) should be in the same place instead of different places but that's my opinion. It does have a new widget setting that's a bit different and updated that I also like. It allows the choice of up to 4 rooms and scenes/color settings for those rooms upon activation of said widget.

Tap on each light and set their temp and brightness, THEN tap + and name the scene you just created. If you want to bring over your pre-made scenes from the original Hue app, just activate the scene with the ORIGINAL app (which still works at the time of this review), then switch to the NEW app and save the scene by hitting the + from the same location as my previous comment. As far as not being able to tap the scene 2 times in the widget to shut the lights off, just create a scene called ""off"" for each room.

I am not missing something. Instead of spending time writing basic functionality, the development team added features such as the ability to Delete a light so that it can no longer be controlled. What use case necessitates that feature? You can't migrate your scenes from v1 of the app, but hey, now you can delete a light and lose control over it! The interface is clunky and unintuitive, it causes you to perform actions that you had no idea were going to happen, the bottom nav changes itself constantly, giving you no anchor back to the main pieces of the app leaving you lost and hitting back > back > back until you finally return back to where you came from so you can restart the process of finding what you were looking for all over again - and then have your bottom nav change again. I could continue. If the dev team is reading this, I am sorry. You probably had decisions made by high ups that forced your hand towards certain features and were inevitably dealing with no budget and a short vigorous timeline. I understand how these things work. That said, there is no excuse for the state of the app that made its way into production. This reminds me of something I would see in a development environment 20 weeks before launch. Something that is unusable, but someone somewhere on some team says something about it and comes up with ideas to make vast improvements to it. I can almost guarantee that this app was written by some business analyst or product owner who blindly passed it to a design team who blindly passed it to the dev team and then it went through one round of QA and some exec said that it has to go live with no additional timeline slippage. It's sad that this sort of thing happens with an app as big as this in a company as large as Philips. It actually makes me lose hope in my profession. Take this app, destroy the source code, and start over."2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,RobertSheaO,2.1.0,3,"The rooms concept is something I've been waiting for! I have almost 40 hue lights in my house and the Gen 1 app is completely useless to me. I use OnSwitch exclusively because of this lacking feature. So, you can imagine my excitement when the Gen 2 app introduced rooms, and my disappointment when I can't add the same light to different rooms. Let me break down my use-case. I have lights in my living room, dining room, kitchen, and entry way, all in their own rooms; however, I want a ""Downstairs"" room so I can control them all together. And in the kitchen, I have light strips that I'd like to group as ""Accent Lighting"". Again, OnSwitch lets you do all this, and Philips should take a cue from them on how to design rooms.P.s. The ability to adjust colors for all lights in a room, like you can with an individual light, would be greatly appreciated."2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,Joris1969,2.1.0,1,"Normaal worden apps beter, maar niet bij Hue.

The original Hue app took some time to learn however I pretty much mastered all of its tools. By no means do I want to take another couple hours to set up my scenes and timers again. Also, the lack of an iPad app is disappointing. The original app had both iPhone and iPad native apps and so should this version in my opinion.Lastly, I would like to encourage Phillips to read these comments and really take to heart that there is a great community of people that love this product.

This app fails at that. It didn't even show up on test day. Why can't this new app have pre-set timers? I looked in ""routines"" and I have to pick a specific time of day for any timed event. Nothing that's a button that you can simply tap any time you want to do a pre-set fade-in/out on a scene. I just want to be able to have some timers for reading for 30/45/60 minutes. I also want to have a widget button that activates, for example, a 45 minute fade-out of my bedroom Lux reading light. And a Siri voice command that does the same thing. This goal is how I judge the app because it's the main advantage I see smart (Lux) lights having one regular lights.Furthermore, I tried to set a reading scene and had to choose a photo but the old app let me ignore the photo and choose from a color/gradient palette or at least pick what spots on the photo to emulate. I may want an icon to represent a scene that doesn't necessarily dictate exactly how the scene looks but this new app appears to require me to drag a photo around so the pixels visible on screen somehow let the lights know how bright they should be? I just wanted to center the book in the icon . . . Why do all routines besides the wake up and sleep routines not let me fade beyond 30 minutes? (Again, it ruins my reading timer.)I have not tried the color scene creation yet because the app will always be one-star to me until a timer feature is added. I already deleted it.

The old app had timers, which could be used to turn on and off lights, with all available features including rooms/lights, colors and time of day.

Each one is supposed to be purpose built with extra features but some basic features like light color/scene isn't available in the wake up routine. These new routine categories add unnecessary complexity to the app. The simpler way to get these features without adding such complexity is to have them all be general routines, and the home screen can then be a unified list of all routines rather than a category selection screen that adds a step. Move the ""category"" concept as a selectable variable within the routine, and then you can show only the features relevant to that routine (eg no color/scene selection on a lights off routine).This new app makes things unnecessarily complicated with deprecated features and a bad user experience."2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,Retoxx,2.1.0,2,"It's ok, for many reasons I still prefer the original app. Thank you for having the sense to keep it available and working.

But whereas Scenes in Gen 1 could control multiple lights in multiple rooms, with this I can't see any other way than one room at a time. It's a nightmare and frankly a massive step backwards in usability. I also have a Hue switch - before pressing one button could change any combination of my 18 lights anywhere in the house so with the four buttons that was loads of flexibility. But with this Gen 2 one, not possible. And to rub salt into the wound Philips have added a pop-up nag on the Gen 1 app that this new one is out.

The main issue is that it didn't seem to recognize an alarm I previously setup with the 1st Hue app.  It didn't even show up in the new app.  So now my lights go on and off per the previous alarm.  I had to go back into the 1st Hue App and erase the alarm.  Then I tried to setup a ""routine"" in this new app to replace the alarm and turn my lights on at 8:30PM and turn them back off at Midnight.  That wasn't working.  I finally figured out that somehow the app either initially created or set the 2nd routine to shut the lights off to ""null"" or ""no"" days of the week.  That isn't even a valid situation, why it saved it that way, I have no idea.   I mean, how much thought does it take to put something like ""if ( daysoftheweek[] == null || daysoftheweek.size() < 1 ) then ""don't save and warn user""???

I have about 14 lights throughout 7 rooms. I don't care if it's less performant, I would rather that to no longer being fully functional since you decided more then four rooms was too slow.

I have a heck of a lot of Hue lights and devices that ended up requiring two different bridges to keep things unclogged.First off I was very surprised that when Philips released this they did not release an iPad version. Really? I always use my iPad and I want the extra resolution which would allow for more information on the screen.  Hopefully that will be coming very soon!Second, no instructions or user guide for a very confusing new revamp of an application? Are you kidding me?OK rant off.  What I really like is the new functionality they have given the Hue touch switches.  Now I can activate up to five different scenes just by the touch of the same button on one switch!  This is very cool because now in my home theater I can virtually run through all my various scenes with just one switch.  Again I had to learn how this switch behavior works just by trial and error. So if I hit the switch once it activates scen one I can now dim seen one or a turn it off. If I want scene two I press the button twice and it activates scene two.  There is no timing in between when you have to press it once or twice. The only way it seems to reset is if you press the off switch on the device.

For example, I had a light grouping for a display case that let me turn on and change settings for six light strips (that together lit the display) in the old app. Now I can no longer select that display unless I make it a room, and I can no longer match or tune the colors to my liking.I'm reverting to the legacy app. It lacks the more modern UI, but it provides the customization that got me to buy into Hue in the first place.

I've recommended them to friends and family, and even bought a set for my sister for Christmas. I don't love them blindly either, as I've tested/used other smart lighting systems over the years such as Lifx, WeMo, etc. Other bulbs I've used, however, exhibited strange flashing issues, tend to overheat or disconnected frequently. I haven't experienced that with Hue lights for the 4 years I've owned them. Now to the app... This app is poorly designed, missing numerous customer requested features, and the features that are included barely work if at all. If this was a first attempt, ok... But Philips, you should have a sleek, rock solid app by now. Your hardware as proven itself to me, but if the software interface ""controlling"" it doesn't work or is a pain to use, what's the point?! The previous version of the app wasn't pretty, but at least it functioned properly. Since I installed this app, I've experienced numerous disconnects, unresponsive bulbs, and an inability to establish a Home/Away connection. The settings that do seem to respond are so cumbersome that I've resorted to downloading a 3rd party app just so I can use my lights. I feel that Philips Bulb users have been patient up until this point, and we deserve better. This attempt leads me to believe that you hired some high school students to design/implement the app as a school project. Except that's insulting to high school students. Fix this app, and make it better."2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,Mdeezie72,2.1.0,1,"The first app was decent - allowed you to make scenes across multiple rooms, utilizing all the potential of these amazing bulbs.

The app does not give me any notifications of its actions so I have to open the app to check if the lights are actually been turned off. There is no support for the watch, although the old watch app was incredibly slow and for that reason I didn't use it I was hoping that gen 2 finally made it useful, not. So many missed chances in this new app. I probably keep using gen 1 for a while until gen 2 gets updated with the bug fixes and the gen 1 features."2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,Benjamin Bale,2.1.0,1,Wat waardeloos!

It loses all previously defined scenes from the first version of the app, because it can't import scenes -- either from Hue gen 1 or from HomeKit. It also has mysterious error messages about naming lights won't work because of conflicting names. If you access your lights on an iPhone and then go to an iPad, it will insist on renaming then all because the first names were all taken by the iPhone. THEY ARE THE SAME LIGHTS AND DON'T NEED TO BE NAMED AGAIN. A problem that is definitely the app's fault is the Today screen widget.

On installing it, I no longer have access to my many scenes... and can no longer make new ones!You can, of course ""create"" scenes. You are prompted to chose a photo from your collection, and after choosing, the app picks what colour the lights will be for you. Perfect -- because I clearly installed an expensive custom lighting system so that I could let a computer choose the colours for me.Moving the photo around results in different colours, but you cannot say, ""I want this particular light to be green, and that one to be blue."" This is a step backwards. The colour-picker images are gone, and tapping on a particular colour in the photo does nothing. Even if you uploaded a gamut rainbow, it would just choose the colours for you. By all means, make it simple for people but at least allow full control for those of us that want it!I had scenes that used a variety of almost-whites depending on the time of day, or matching up with other non-Hue bulbs. Such subtlety is now impossible.While being able to group lights into rooms is a much needed addition (finally!) I'm clearly not going to be using them, because the old app is far superior in colour selection.

Please add timers back in to the app. Initial reviewI like the new interface, but there are some key features that you've removed (for no obvious reason):- Timers - alarms remain, but timers have gone. That makes no sense. So I have to use the Gen 1 app for timers. The light fading out when going to sleep is just as good as it fading in when waking up, unless I go to sleep at exactly the same time every night, a ""Routine"" just won't work. - Linking lights - setting different lights to be the same colour is a very useful feature. Surely it's easy to implement and doesn't have to be a permanent link. Even a ""copy settings"" feature would work. Improvements:- UI in general- auto-generated icon for a scene actually looks like the colours in the scene, not just a generic colour palette or having to find a picture from somewhere (no more pages of scenes with the same icon)- rooms and switching whole rooms on and off quickly"2.02E+13,1.8,Philips Hue,Nog for,2.1.0,1,"The latest app eliminates scenes that I took a lot of time to create.

Sure automation's awesome but some of the fun of getting a product like this is still having more options to directly manipulate the lights on-demand!  With this app you can't get an overview of all of your lights at-a-glance like in the Gen 1 app, and you can't adjust brightness or colour in tandem. This app has a feel that there wasn't much user consultation during the design phase; like there was more direction over presentation compared to function. I believe if passionate users were consulted prior to development some of the missing tools would never have been cut.

The ability to create rooms is nice and the updated design is nice to look at.The interface and organization is really confusing.

My scenes and rules weren't imported from the old app. Pretty disappointed.",1.8,Philips Hue,Antoke420,2.1.0,4,"I love the new layout! I like how everything is organized by rooms rather than having random lights scattered in an unorganized list like in generation one. I also like how you can dim the lights to certain percentages. It's also much more responsive. I honestly don't see why people don't like the new updateit's awesome! It would've been five stars but the number one thing I dislike about the new update is that it's not compatible with the iPad.

You'd think after paying so much for some lightbulbs you'd get a good app to go along with it. The 1st Generation app wasn't as visually appealing as the 2nd Generation app, but the 1st one worked so much better. You can no longer control lights individually and can only place the bulbs in ""rooms"". I still have the old app installed because I like it so much more. The new app is hard to use. I was hoping that the hype about the 2nd generation app would actually live up to all the high expectations but unfortunately it seems that nearly everyone who has used this app has nothing good to say about it at all. 1 star average rating? How sad.",1.8,Philips Hue,ROCK3NROLLA,2.1.0,1,"This update is terrible. You cannot match the colors of your grouped lights. To create a scene is a nightmare. There is no color board when making a new scene. No off button on the widget, you have to open the app just to turn off a group of lights. I wish I never updated.

That just duplicated everything.,1.8,Philips Hue,First Raider,2.1.0,1,"Latest update still does not address any of the problems that have been brought up with the new app. There is no import function so if you want to use only this app, get ready to manually recreate all your previous setting/scenes. The addition of rooms is an improvement (possibly the only one) but now everything only functions by room instead of allowing the option to use certain bulbs from different rooms (like turning off the lights in one room and simultaneously turning the lights on in another or turning on the lights in more than one location.)  The emphasis on photo-based scenes (mostly a novelty at best) still does not have the ability to choose specific bulb color and grouping is still not possible. Plus, in case you want to have multiple bulbs in one room with the same color, good luck getting all of them to match correctly.  Overall, Philips once again demonstrates a knack for excellent hardware and absolutely terrible (and clueless) software, even in their updates.",1.8,Philips Hue,tech302,2.1.0,1,New app isn't even finished.

Example of a major missing item in this new version: you can't create a scene with more than 4 rooms and also be able to add lights of different dims and colors at the same time.  I have a night light scene that turns on 8 lights in 4 areas of my house with 6 colors/dims.   Can't with the new one.",1.8,Philips Hue,Yelloduc,2.1.0,1,"You have got to be kidding me right?

Doch warum wurden einige, wie ich finde, wichtige Funktionen der alten App verworfen. Drei Punkte dazu.- Warum gibt es die App nicht mehr fr das iPad? Gerade zu Hause wird dieses Device benutzt und wird gerne fr die Bedienung der Hue-Produkte verwendet...- Warum wurde die Funktion, zum Einstellen der Farbe fr meherer Lampen gleichzeitig, eingestellt. Was meine ich genau: in der alten App konnte man zu einer Szene Leuchten hinzufgen, diese dann verbinden und so hatte alle Leuchten die selbe Farbe und Helligkeit. Nun werde die Farben der Lecuhten bei Szenen automatisch erstellt und m_chte ich zwei Leuchten die selbe Farbe und Helligkeit zuweisen, geht das nur separat und umst_ndlich.- Der letze Punkt greift ein wenig in den Punkt zwei: Mir ist bewusst, dass es unter normalen Umst_nden logisch erscheint, dass eine Leuchte nur in einem Raum platziert werden kann. In der neuen App muss (kann) eine Leuchte einem Raum zugeordnet werde. Man kann dann ber den Schalter Wohnzimmer alle Leuchten im Wohnzimmer anschalten. Wenn ich nun aber eine Wohnkche habe (wie bei mir der Fall) konnte ich in der alten App einen Szenen erstellen, in welcher ich alles Leuchten aus Wohnzimmer und Kche zusammengefassen konnte. Somit alle Leuchten zentral steurbar. In der neuen App msst ich die Leuchten dem jeweiligen Raum zuordnen. Dass msste ich machen um nicht immer wenn ich im Wohnzimmer bin auch die Lichter in der Kche angehen. Leider ist es in er neuen App jedoch nur m_glich einen Lampe einem Raum zuzuordenen.

The 'Coming home' and 'Leaving home' don't work in Gen 2 of the app, unlike its ugly cousin, Gen 1.Secondly, as someone who's frequently away, what's the point in having a wake-up and sleep routine if you can't toggle it to only trigger if you're actually home. Given that the app is always aware of your location, this seems standard.",1.8,Philips Hue,Hafiz R,2.1.0,5,"I have read some of the other reviews here- and I have to agree to disagree with them. I own near enough 150 various hue products/bulbs strips etc, and use 3 bridges at the same time - have ALL types of hue range products, using them for over 2 years;  So I know what I am talking about. This appis tonnes better than any other app out there - and I have tried nearly all of them! It's not simple for dummies - then dummies shouldn't be using these bulbs with app- stick to the switches they can come with.I can't thank Philips enough for update to gen 2; now it's the only app I use; bridge switching is easy; bulbs rooms; scenes and themes much easier to manage. On iPhone it's a pure delight to use- and creating you own scene is so cool! Not to mention very easyIn fact other than sounds and dynamic themes- Philips have thought about everything practical. Please include dynamic scenes in your next update!Remember the app facilitates the use of the bridge and bulbs; and other products- it's he primary software to run the hardware of hue products; there are heaps and heaps of various apps that do different things. So get those; find one for your need; as a primary app this has done an excellent job and is VERY simple to use- if you know how hue range work and how to utilise them to begin with. This app will be the killer of paid hue apps hence so much negativity I think. The only negative about hue range/ product is that they are expensive. But find product of similar quality, build and innovation then compare. There are so many car makers- but most will know an Audi, BMW and Mercs are what they are; and hue lights are just hue lights- and this app is fantastic- well done Philips!

Forced to scroll through 100's of images(Scenes are currently unusable, and IMO you should remove them until this feature is minimally ready - make them ""returning soon"").The new app:Good:Better interface designBad:- Cannot control where individual lights pick up colours from a recipe image (shuffle isn't enough; some of your users bought into your system because they want the control)- Finding images in camera roll can be painful if you have a lot of images.

Hier muss die Hue App V1 verwendet werden. Auerdem ist es echt schade, dass eine Lampe nur einmal angesprochen werden kann, sprich keine Raumbergreifenden Szenen (mit Mehrfachbelegungen) m_glich. Beim erstellen einer Szene per Foto ist nur die Zufallsfunktion m_glich, in der alten App konnte man jeder Lampe auf einen Farbbereich im Foto zuweisen - diese Funktion habe ich nicht gefunden. Szenen k_nnen aus der alten App bernommen werden, auch wenn nur einzeln was etwas umst_ndlich ist. Auerdem funktioniert bei mir die Ortungsfunktion nicht. Lampen werden weder an- noch ausgeschaltet. Man kann auch nicht mehr den Radius bestimmen. Einfache Features die jedoch essentiell sind und bei dem Lampenpreis nicht fehlen drfen.

And yet, with this new app, the bulb is only able to be accessed by recipe from the room in which it's assigned.

Right now, the only way the lights will work is if they are in range of a bridge separated by walls, etc. If you can slave bridges to a master, fixed! Lastly, stick with the old app concept without a wholesale app change!",1.8,Philips Hue,johnbowen,2,1,"They have made this app so simple that it lacks many features of the original app. I make up lighting schemes based on not one room, but an areas within my home.

Also earlier versions of the Hue will have certain issues since the newer products will have better reliability and other important improvements made. However the choices of which products and softwares to use, the choices made depends on you.",1.8,Philips Hue,LuciusJF,2,1,"Don't say you're stopping support for the old app that is working until you figure out the new app. The new app looks good, but a lot of functionality has been taken away. Basic use cases are not even addressed/considered in the new app. What if I don't want to turn all the lights on in one room?",1.8,Philips Hue,ThatMichael,2,1,"This app makes me angry. I love my Hue, and have replace almost all the lights in my apartment with Hue bulbs. But this app ruins the experience and has me thinking I've wasted a lot of money. I can only imagine that the people who built it have never even seen Hue lights, let alone used them. The rooms feature has some potential, but right now it's useless. Especially since scenes can only control lights within a single room. My condo has an open floor plan, so all my carefully crafted scenes affect all the ""rooms"" I have. The only way to get the same behavior in the new app is to say my entire apartment is one single room. So rooms ... pointless. Speaking of scenes, Creating them in the new app is a nightmare. Totally gone is any way of grouping lights and setting them to the same color. Want the two bulbs in that one lamp to be the same color? Yeah, good luck with that. Photo scenes are just bonkers now because the only option is to let the app randomly assign colors to the lights in the room. This is a silly party trick, not a useful feature. My recommendation is to add scenes to the main nav (along with Rooms, Routines and More) and just replicate the same scene features and behaviors from the original app. Call it something new if you have to - I don't care. All I want is to create, activate and deactivate scenes for all my bulbs as easily as I could do it in the original app.",1.8,Philips Hue,Abombito,2,2,"I hesitated downloading this new version for a while because of the negative reviews and concerns about undoing what I already had in place (I also use IF).

It is NOT intuitive to use, very difficult to use!  For instance, the first version has a simple button in the middle of the home screen to simply shut off all of the lights when you wish (very easy!).  With the new app, who the hecks knows how shut off the lights with one click?!?!?  Why is ""wake up"" a routine, yet when I create a routine, it goes under a different folder?  That means having to click on the screen again.  Most people set their lights to ""timers"", why call them ""routine"" in the new app??  NOT user friendly!  I will delete and use the first version.",1.8,Philips Hue,Denis251,2,1,I have been using the gen 1 app just fine for a year. Just uninstalled the gen 2 app as it won't connect to the bridge.

I really miss the colour palette options. This app feels like a bit of a backwards step in my opinion.,1.8,Philips Hue,Lilfraz,2,2,"Firstly, app looks great, it's a much more modern interface than the original app and I like that. I also like how you've allowed the creation of rooms so that scenes created for these rooms only affect the bulbs in it.HOWEVER,Why can we not custom map each bulb to a specific point on a photo anymore??? What's up with that? I have a converted garage that is now a room for films, TV and gaming and have set scenes for favourite sports teams etc. Where I have set each bulb individually to get the result I want. Don't take that away from me.Until this is sorted I will be sticking with the 1st gen app as it gives me much more control over the look of the room. As someone else has put it, this new app is the ""for dummies"" version for people that can't be arsed to go through the effort of setting the room up properly and are just happy with something ok.Not for me",1.8,Philips Hue,Wallywalts,2,2,"Somehow Phillips have managed to create an app that is worse and better at the same time. The UX is just not intuitive and functionality is worse.Pros: interface is more modern and clean.. thats about itCons: functionality is greatly reduced, so much so I've gone back to ""gen 1"". Main gripe I have is the scenes can only be set for one room at a time. e.g. In ""gen 1"" had a ""Movie"" scene that would turn off all the lights in the house apart from one light in the living room that is set to very dim. Easy with the old app to do, just create a scene, choose your lights and levels and good to go. Even works with Siri. Not possible with ""gen 2"". Each scene can only be set per room, so forget trying to say to Siri ""set movie"" as she'll only activate the scene in one room and for all lights in that room. Useless. One advantage of upgrading to HomeKit is any third party app can control so don't need to wait for Philips to fix it, or can just go back to the old app for now.",1.8,Philips Hue,carbinez,2,2,where is The timer? suddenly its gone,1.8,Philips Hue,Edcontente,2,2,"A reforma foi bem vinda, o antigo App j est ultrapassado, apesar de muito eficiente.

It may be aesthetically pleasing but the Interface is ridiculous. Yes it has simplified certain actions but it also took away major functions (most importantly grouping lights).

It feels like they have a single junior coop student writing this app given a testing setup of one bulb in a closet down the hall.  Every person writing this app should be forced to have every bulb in their house/apartment changed with hue bulbs.",1.8,Philips Hue,AppleAttorney,2,1,"So first, if you like your scenes and individual light control, do  not download this app.This is the app they should have come out with two years ago.

If I wanted bulbs that turned on and off or showed up as some shade of white/yellow, I would've just bought regular bulbs and used the wall switch. You now have remarkably advanced light bulbs that your App dumbs down regular, 15-year-ago light bulbs. Also - why can't I assign bulbs to multiple rooms?!

They have given no path the migrate all the scenes you've created, dumbed this app, limited to an iPhone interface ignoring iPads.  It is pretty and big, like much recent over-simplistic interface design (thank you google) and they have also given us minimal usability - at least compared to the previous Hue app.  However, at least you can turn light groups off and on room at a time.

Old app would always bump random lights out of groups causing frustration.  Now it is easily done.  Groups can also be individual named, allowing easier use of Siri voice commands - Dimming lights.  The use of an easy fader bar is much better than the previous app, making it quicker and easier to turn down a group of lights.- Use of Scenes.  Quick and easy to use scenes now.  However, I never use scenes.And now the bad:-Scenes have replaced colour option for lights.-Changing bulb colours.  The whole fun of hue is the colour options, but this app is a huge step backward.  You can only choose specific scenes and can't control the colour of a specific bulb.  The Ugly:  The truth is if you took this app, blended it with the previous app you'd have a pretty good app to control you Hue system.  Sadly you're stuck jumping between the apps to be able to use all the features.  At the end of the day there are better 3rd party apps to control and customize your Hues with. This app is a decent addition, but only does half of what it should.  Hopefully future updates will address this.Bottom Line: Skip this app and download one of the highly rated 3rd party hue apps.

On iPhone it's a pure delight to use- and creating you own scene is so cool! Not to mention very easyIn fact other than sounds and dynamic themes- Philips have thought about everything practical. Please include dynamic scenes in your next update!Remember the app facilitates the use of the bridge and bulbs; and other products- it's he primary software to run the hardware of hue products; there are heaps and heaps of various apps that do different things. So get those; find one for your need; as a primary app this has done an excellent job and is VERY simple to use- if you know how hue range work and how to utilise them to begin with. This app will be the killer of paid hue apps hence so much negativity I think. The only negative about hue range/ product is that they are expensive. But find product of similar quality, build and innovation then compare. There are so many car makers- but most will know an Audi, BMW and Mercs are what they are; and hue lights are just hue lights- and this app is fantastic- well done Philips!

Sure I sort of understand it but it's not the way most people are used to using the hue. You gave us scenes in the first version then got rid of them in this version. Why? Why can't I make a scene that incorporates multiple rooms or a combination of lights across several rooms. What if I just want a reading light on in my living room? Your new way removes my ability to set up that scene. Either that or you've so obscured that option it's impossible to find. This version is definitely a step backwards.

The biggest annoyance of this redesign is that the app doesn't allow for us to choose what colors our bulbs can be for a scene but instead it ""shuffles"" the colors for us. I bought the hue lights so that I can light specific areas of my home a certain way but this update ruined that.The app is also extremely buggy.

The new color pickers are much easier to use and allow you to get the full range of color out of your bulbs.

Scenes have been dumbed down to the point that they are utterly useless. It's almost laughable. There is no way to actually customize or edit any scene short from hitting a randomize button. I was hoping that Philips would actually try and fix the scene editing interface rathen than just decapitating it.2. While room grouping is a welcome change, there is still no concept of grouping lights together as one logical unit (zone?). So if you have any rooms with multiple light fixtures that have multiple lights, good luck to you. You can turn a room on and off, but if you want a scene where some light fixtures are on and some are off or at different levels of itensity with different color, no go.3. Also, there is no way to create a scene that sets lights for multiple rooms. So if you have a relatively open floor plan and you want to configure your lights to dim down an adjacent room to watch a movie in the living area, no go.4. It is unclear if the Home & Away feature actually works with multiple users.This app might work well for customers that have bought a starter kit to play with the lights but it doesn't serve anyone that actually made a considerable investment in installing hue lights in an entire house.",1.8,Philips Hue,Eamon N.,2,3,"Please make this app universal.

And it never lands on the ONE number you want to call. That's basically what this app does with lights.If hue doesn't fix this crap I'm for sure going to switch over to one of the other light systems out there. Because honestly I feel ripped off for spending my money on a product that used to let you do anything you wanted to do with your lights and now you can't do crap with it anymore. Or if you can make a tutorial for it. But yeah, this is what happens when you try to improve/fix something that was already freaking awesome",1.8,Philips Hue,ChiRho112,2,1,"I got the notification of the new software.

On top of that, it's hell to figure out how to merely adjust *one bulb* (after grouping into rooms - which I hate - you tap on the room, then tap on a bulb name, then go through two more steps to adjust brightness and color, as opposed to the one step in the old app). All around, this app has the feeling that it was designed by engineers who never used the bulbs or the old app in a real world setting - like their own homes.

It loses all previously defined scenes from the first version of the app, because it can't import scenes -- either from Hue gen 1 or from HomeKit. It also has mysterious error messages about naming lights won't work because of conflicting names. If you access your lights on an iPhone and then go to an iPad, it will insist on renaming then all because the first names were all taken by the iPhone.

Suffice it to say, no changes are improvements, and any change that is not a regression is just a worse method of accomplishing whatever arrangements you have already done on gen 1.  A previous reviewer said that the app was ""dumbed down"": this is too charitable.  This app is not ""dumbed down"", as that implies simplified.  This app is not simplified, but it is ""dumbed"".  The app may be more useable to a toddler, but for someone that wants actual elegance and control over thier Hue Ecosystem, this gen 2 is grotesque.

But that was essential to the first gen app.,1.8,Philips Hue,@Kalapana,2,1,"There are a bunch of features that were reduced and dumbed down on Gen 2. *Dimming function is now reduced from 60 mins to 30. So if you create two timers to fade into each other, it happens too quickly. It should have been extended as it works great for moving from diner time to sleep time. * There is still a over use of the silly photo thing. There are only so many colors these lights can produce and the Home app seems to have better control of that.  A simple color palette would have worked fine. * Gen 1 could easily do rooms separately as well and it was easiest to just create a page for each room, add the 4 recipes and a couple of customs then you were done. * Finally They need a beta program for everyone to test out before release. It would save so the so much time, money and complaints.",1.8,Philips Hue,chatmandu,2,1,"don't be surprised when you cannot use Siri to control your lights anymore. the upgrade completely wrecks your phone's previous settings. enjoy completely setting everything up again and then not having the functionalities of the previous version. garbage app, poor programming.",1.8,Philips Hue,eGREGious87,2,1,"Take the abilities of the Gen 1 app with the style of Gen 2 and you got yourself a cool new app. Take basic functions that have existed from the very beginning and take them away, you get this app. Scenes which are so important in the Gen 1 app are buried in this app. NOT BEING ABLE TO MIGRATE SCENES FROM ONE APP TO ANOTHER MAKES THIS APP USELESS. I can see them on your website, how can I not see existing scenes on your new app. Rooms while a good idea is so less important then being able to group lights (aka scenes) Back to the drawing board Phillips.",1.8,Philips Hue,Steven majersky,2,1,Didn't even open this app after reading the reviews. It sounds to me that this app is only going to mess up everything I've set up already. I'm really disappointed in Philips hue for not making better apps. You would think that they would have the best apps of there products but they seem to be mediocre at best. I really hope Philips reads these reviews. I love there product but like I said there apps need work.,1.8,Philips Hue,Mizzar,2,1,"This app needs an update.

I concur what others brought up. Also, it's still surprisingly inconvenient UX. Is there any scenario this was optimized for?",1.8,Philips Hue,KatieGramma,2,1,"No customization! That's the first thing missing. Then there's the requirement to set lights by room...what if I want one light in a room sometimes and three other times? Sorry...I'm keeping and using the old app until you fix this one. Boo, Hue!",1.8,Philips Hue,Quinneilious,2,1,"this app throws away the ability to control lights in groups or independently in favor of control of ""rooms"". The UI is slower and more confusing than gen 1, and removes some of the greatest features. I was really looking forward to the routines, but there is very little change between those and the timers in the original app.",1.8,Philips Hue,wrennyc,2,1,I'm sticking with the original app until this new app allows importing all the scenes that I've set up with the original app. Whoever allowed this app to be releases without this feature should be fired.,1.8,Philips Hue,MoRon9000,2,4,Where is the watch support? Is the problem this it isn't native? Make it native so it's faster. Come on now.,1.8,Philips Hue,Vinrod,2,1,"For the cost of these lights and a brand name like Phillips, you would think they would make an app that actually works!! Phillips should be ashamed of themselves for putting their name on a piece of junk app like this!!",1.8,Philips Hue,dylanlive,2,3,"Ah, a much needed refresh! Finally! The ability to quickly turn rooms on and off. I can move between rooms with a breeze.I feel like everything is much more natural on initial setup. Great UI, great icons.However, there are some caveats. I can no longer choose which lights get which color on the scenes. This leads me to tapping Shuffle a dozen or so times and finally settling. It's important to have this control of your lights are arranged a certain way.The old scenes from Gen 1 also don't seem to sync over. This is a disappointment.Also, I can't seem to disable a Coming Home scene - I untapped the room but I can't untap home.Geofencing ability is minimal. I like Apple's way to set the range. I couldn't find a way to change the location after it chose it, or its borders.Overall, a solid more intuitive design, but it needs to bring back advanced functionality for my full stars to return.",1.8,Philips Hue,basepi,2,2,"This app can do most of what the first app could do. But it's missing one feature: scenes that include multiple rooms. You can mostly get there. Widgets allow you to set a scene across multiple rooms. But the problem is widgets don't sync with Siri. There is no way to have Siri control two rooms at once, that I can find. (i.e. Dining and living, which in my house are actually practically the same room, but I still want to be able to control them separately)Another solution would be to allow bulbs to belong to multiple rooms. That way I could create the normal dining and living rooms, but also create a ""front"" room or ""main"" room which includes the bulbs from both.In any case, this lack of functionality is a huge regression from v1 of the app. Hopefully it gets fixed.",1.8,Philips Hue,Cmummert,2,1,"Philips, you did a complete redesign of an app that just needed improvement. I HATE the new app!! There are some good features, like room grouping. However I had scenes that were for multiple rooms & now scenes are within a group. I don't plan on using this app, I'll stick with the old one.",1.8,Philips Hue,hleumas,2,3,"This isn't much of an improvement over the gen1 app. It's shiny, but it's a pain to migrate to. The addition of support for rooms is handy, until you want to configure a custom scene using more than one room. It would have been nice if they had provided the ability to transfer/sync the scenes and alarms (now called ""routines""). But there is no such option. You have to reconfigure all of it.There's no Apple Watch support, and the notification center widgets are less intuitive. You can't double tap a widget to turn a scene off. Instead, you have to make a widget just for turning whole rooms of lights off.",1.8,Philips Hue,ChrisCrayton,2,1,"This app is awful. The interface is inscrutable, and trying to do anything is frustrating. They need to spend more time on usability and less on trying to be cool. Zero stars.",1.8,Philips Hue,dvs11198,2,1,So much functionality is gone. It's much more cumbersome to use. The user interface is not so great in this version. Restoring the widget functionality of turning scenes on and off with the same push of a button would be a great start.,1.8,Philips Hue,SirPat15,2,2,"Overall the new app looks better, and some new things added. The most evident thing is the removal of the color mixer for lights, removal of ""Scenes"" and no forward over of Scenes or colors from there previous app. Also the menus are confusing and need more thought out toward them.The app is a step in the right[ish] direction, but it needs to carry over the futures from the previous generation one application.

I hate it that I have to actually choose a star. There's no more grouping lights or manually selecting colors. You can't choose specific areas of an image for a light.

This thing is a total train wreck! Would anybody please recommend some third-party applications that are better now?,1.8,Philips Hue,MJTXFL,2,1,Some things work better then gen 1.  Philips you are making a smart home app.  Most developers are adding rotation to their apps...you take it away. You had the ability to tile 20 scenes...you now make it so you can see 4 at a time.  I thought this was an update...more like a step back. The only plus I see is it looks like it now supports multiple hubs.,1.8,Philips Hue,HyFydelity,2,2,"The room feature is great, but the individual light control, bulbs in multiple groups and detailed scene creation are all features that made the Hue system so great, we need these features back. The new app, while an improvement with its new interface, is seriously lacking in core features. Phillips, please bring these features back!!!!",1.8,Philips Hue,tido2012,2,1,"Horrible App.  Still can't figure out how to create different scenes. Can't have the same bulb in two different scenarios, i.e. light strips that need to be a part of ""movie scene"" and part of ""relax scene"".  I understand that this is an attempt to make apple's home automation competitive, but this needs a lot of work to be functional.",1.8,Philips Hue,Sg223,2,1,This app really breaks the system. Too difficult to figure out how to make simple groups like the original app. Glad I'm keeping the original app.....please let us incorporate old groups into this one.,1.8,Philips Hue,ThomasSerio,2,2,"The new app fails in several ways. The biggest failing is the inability to assign bulbs to more than one ""room"". The quotes are important, since you might want to define a room as the whole house, or several physical rooms. Since a bulb can only be in one ""room"" in the app, you're out of luck if you want scenes that apply to a single room *and* scenes that are for larger areas in the house (like, say, a scene for a living room night light and a scene for watching TV that affects lights in the living room and nearby dining room). Technically you could define a single room for all the bulbs and then create a ton of scenes, but it's awkward and you'll still run into a problem if you want to turn on lights in two separate physical rooms independently.The other issue is that there's no good way to import scenes and settings from the old app. You have to activate a scene in the old app, then use the add scene button. You need to do this for each scene, and again you're out of luck if you want to copy a scene spanning rooms.I also noticed the app had a hard time connecting to certain lights. They'd become unresponsive for a while, sometimes requiring restarting the app.All in all, this app is an attempt to streamline the interface, but in doing so makes the app less usable. Hopefully this gets addressed in future updates.For now I'd recommend staying on the gen 1 app until lights are allowed to span rooms and the connectivity to the lights gets a little more stable.",1.8,Philips Hue,alahao,2,5,"Everything take less steps to setup, love it!",1.8,Philips Hue,blumenbach,2,1,"I don't know who designed this for Philips, from the result I'm sure they could have found a better person in a grade school art class.

I want it to not come on 8pm but around that time varied each day. Same with other rooms I set. I set this according to sunset but an auto set to come on round sunset would be a good option so I don't have to change the timer when the clocks go forward or back.

The ""features"" of this ""new"" app are basically the worst ideas they could possibly come up with.  To keep scenes limited to Rooms means that if you'd like to create mood lighting for your entire home, you can't. If you'd like to turn off the lights in the bedroom and the bathroom with one tap, you can't.  Not only did they NOT add a color picker to create a scene, they took away EVERYTHING! You have to use photos from your photo library. If I want to make a scene with multiple colors somehow it's now my responsibility to search for or take a photo of those colors just to have something to create it. And that's RIDICULOUS if you have more than even 5 bulbs. Let's say the photo only has a small piece of blue in it. There is no way you can cram all your lights into that space. It's dependent on the photo. There is not one thing this app brings to the table that the original app doesn't already have, other than, I'm told, quicker response time, which I still have no evidence for.

Huemote is something Phillips needs to seriously think about buying or copying. Failure.,1.8,Philips Hue,telecastle,2,3,"Philips Hue Generation 1 app is a pre-HomeKit-era app that has no concept of rooms. Instead, multiple lights could be bundled together into scenes. Multiple lights could be controlled (brightness, color hues, and on/off status) as a scene. Scenes could be shared via the meethue.comportal among several devices logged in to the same meethue.com portal.   Philips retrofitted Hue Generation 1 app with HomeKit compatibility in 2015 (when it introduced the square version of the Hue Bridge). The only two features of Hue Generation 1 app that were compatible with HomeKit were the names of the Hue lights added in the Hue app and the scenes created in the Hue App. Both the names of lights and the scenes could be exported to HimeKit, but that integration was not dynamic, and the synchronization between the Hue app and HomeKit occurred only at the time of export (via the ""Siri voice control"" feature of the Hue app). Philips Hue Generation 2 app was redesigned based on the Smart Home concepts based around rooms. In Hue Generation 2 app, lights are first assigned to rooms. Once the room is created and lights are added, a scene can be created for the room. In fact, scenes can only be created for rooms - no longer for discrete lights. Because of that, scenes created in Hue Generation 1 app cannot be shared with Hue Generation 2 app. The real inconvenience of this is that the Hue Switch configured in Hue Generation 1 app has the scenes (assigned to its buttons) that cannot be seen in Hue Generation 2 app. Many users here complain that they can no longer control a subset of lights as one scene unless they place these lights in the same Hue Generation 2 app room. This can be easily achieved, however, via true HomeKit apps, such as Home. The Home app (which is the most comprehensive HomeKit app (which looks like an app that Apple should have released for HomeKit, but never did), allows one to configure scenes that can be created based on Descartes lights rather than on HimeKit rooms. Therefore, along with the Hue App Generation 2 app scenes (based solely on rooms) and exported to HomeKit, one can create additional HimeKit scenes that span the HomeKit rooms. The downside is that HimeKit scenes do not sync back to Hue Generation 2 app. My conclusion is that if you are interested in integrating Hue lights into HomeKit (along with other HomeKit compatible accessories from other manufacturers, use Hue Generation 2 app). If, however, you are not interested in Apple HomeKit integration, and especially, if you want to control discrete lights located in different rooms as one action, use Hue Generation 1 app.",1.8,Philips Hue,R00M237,2,1,"Absolutely no significant functional improvement, in fact a regression with several features.

The new app removes a lot of the functionality of the original, although does look slightly prettier. If function is low on your list of priorities then switch to this app. I would recommend looking for other options for home lighting automation unless Phillips actually put some of our money to fine tuning their products to make them viable for stress free home use.

I can't actually remember in the UI how to get to this feature - just been searching and frankly have no idea, but going on my memory when I did stumble across it, you are forced to use a photo, you can't place a bulb on the photo to select the colour you want... But what's more annoying is I can't get to the standard colour sheet (as in not using a photo at all) where I can select my own colours, group bulbs into a single colour and add others around it.

Ich habe also fr jeden dieser Bereiche einen Raum in der App angelegt (wenn ich im Essbereich bin, muss nicht das Licht im Bro brennen usw.).Nachdem alle R_ume angelegt waren, wollte ich einen Raum namens ""Loft"" anlegen, in den ALLE Bereiche meiner Wohnung enthalten sind - geht nicht. Weil eine Doppelbelegung von Lampen nicht vorgesehen ist. Und das finde ich echt schwach, zumal der Trend doch unumstritten zu zumindest offenen Koch- und Wohnbereichen geht. Das konnte ich vorher (in der alten App) wunderbar ber die Szenen regeln. Da hatte ich eine Szene fr Kche, eine fr Kche+Wohnraum, eine fr Kche+Essbereich, eine fr Wohnraum+Essbereich, usw..Ihr habt in meinen Augen den Aspekt, dass ein Raum mehrere Bereiche haben kann, v_llig bersehen.

Sure, some people might like to be hip and use one of the scenes that makes all the bulbs different colors that look 'really hip' together or whatever, however, some of us like to have uniformity in our colors and the loss of that feature over the older version really makes this a pain in the arse to to use when we want to change the color on the fly and their is no scene set for it.  Also, as was previously mentioned, there needs to be an option to add a light to multiple 'rooms'.  There could be situations where a bulb that is positioned in certain areas of the house could overlap multiple rooms.  In other words it could be a desire of someone to have a particular light turned on when either of two rooms were turned on.  As it is currently, a bulb may only be assigned a single 'room' designation.  Also desired would be a 'room' that contains all the bulbs on your bridge.  This is another feature that is sorely miss over the old version.  Having the ability to see all of your bulbs in one place and adjust the brightness and colors on a color scheme just seems like common sense.

(havent tested this, but will report back if its problematic)There is finally the ability to group lights together by room (or really anything you want). A nice touch is that I can have lights that are members of more than one room, which is perfect because it lets me have a dining/living combined room as well as individual rooms for those, which works nicely since my dining and living rooms are right next to one another. I still have access to scenes which is nice, but they are no longer the top-level way of controlling things; they are where they belong, nested within the rooms construct.One very important aspect of rooms support that makes me super happy: I went to set up the app on a second phone I have, and all the rooms are there waiting for me. The gen 1 apps syncing of scenes was a total nightmare and Im glad to see that they finally addressed it; previously I was afraid to touch my scenes on my secondary devices.Often I still find myself wanting to control an individual light, and thats still buried, but I can always put individual lights in their own rooms if I want. Im surprised you cant 3D touch the home screen icon and have quick access to actions; that seems like low hanging fruit. Itd be even nicer if the whole app had 3D touch support for making certain actions faster for power users.The execution of the app is still a bit 1.0; it feels a bit finicky at times, and it misses certain things, like not even being able to tell me what my Hue Tap buttons do because I configured them in the old app. Theres no iPad support, which is a shame but I hope its coming later. I still primarily interact with my devices by secondary means and not directly by the app (my Flic buttons and Tap switches are great, and Im thinking about acquiring an Echo at some point; Siri is awful), but im excited to see that I can have quicker, fine-grained access to control my lights from my phone again.

Power users will want to continue controlling their lights via other, superior HomeKit apps or desktop scripts. Siri still gets my light commands right only half the time.  The ugly: widgets are now limited to controlling four rooms. Switches are limited to three rooms. Both changes cite ""to ensure a fast response"" which on one hand I appreciate, but I would like the option to settle for a slower response in exchange for controlling more rooms. I can no longer use my hue tap to turn off all my lights on my way out the door! The hue tap, unlike Siri or even the app is 99% reliable in giving successful commands. The biggest improvement (fast response) is thus also the biggest drawback: the inability of widgets and switches to control ALL my lights simultaneously.

This is a review of the new app only.The gen1 app was absolutely abysmal, which is sad for such a great product.  Reliance on 3rd party apps is risky, and almost stopped my continued implementation of the bulbs.  This 2nd gen app is better, but I'm really frustrated that Philips didn't make the effort to learn from mistakes and understand what people need in an app.  I've spent a fortune on this system and I don't think it's too much to expect a decent app without having to spend more money on other unreliable apps.The Good (and there is good):-HomeKit integration - thank you!  This alone encouraged me to expand my system despite the app-Rooms!!!  Finally I can now group bulbs together and control them with Siri.-Home/Away and routines are a great step in the right direction-Overall the updated interface is more intuitive and looks goodThe Bad-What happened to the blinking light when assigning names to newly installed bulbs?  When installing multiples, it's impossible to determine which is which easily and requires testing and extra time to get it right.  Please put this back!-Poor database management.  If I delete a name because I didn't get it right the first time or I have to reinstall the app or the bulb itself, I can never use the same names again.  At this rate, my hall lights will have to be labeled as ""Hall4768"" which I'll never remember when using Siri.  See I'd already tried hallway and corridor with every iteration in between before the lights finally worked right - by then appropriate names were gone.  Seriously?  When I delete a bulb or room, it should delete it from the database and allow names to be re-used.-Bulb connectivity is lost WAY MORE, which means I have to install and reinstall more (see previous points for impact)-Siri voice control sync issues.  Wha???  Trying to resolve the sync issue means visiting every room and light setup to determine the problem.  I have several sync issues a day and this is out of control-Scenes.  While I do like the new look of scenes, why didn't all those scenes I painstakingly created port over?  And why must scenes ALSO not allow names to be used again?  For that matter, why not allow one scene that can be Siri controlled for any room? This needs better room integration-Why can you not assign a scene for wake up or timed events?  That's key for max usability-Why no blink function with routines?  Need another option besides fadeI hope future releases will address these issues, but frankly I'm not holding my breath since it took forever to get rooms, which is such a basic function.Still, I do love the bulbs and Siri control.  And, I am thankful for HomeKit integration.  I'm also in love with the dimmer switches/remotes and the Hue Go.  Add a motion sensor to the switch and it would be perfect!",1.8,Philips Hue,Sergioxantos,2,1,I updated to the this new app from the old a and lost all my scene setups. I cannot control scene creation like i did in the previous app. Only shuffle colors. Very dissapointed. I am switching back to the old app,1.8,Philips Hue,ProShot2020,2,1,"Several HUGE issues with this. 1) You CANNOT have lights be part of more than one ""room"". So if I want to have a scene that controls multiple rooms simultaneously, well, you can't unless you set up your entire house as a single room (which will delete any other rooms you have set up. INCOMPREHENSIBLY STUPID.2) No way to manually set the color of groups of lights simultaneously (you just have to eyeball it if you want to create a scene where all the bulbs in a room are the same orange). Feature regression, we used to be able to do this. 3) It takes me way more clicks/scrolls to get to where I'm turning a scene on than it used to. The rooms/scenes division makes me have to keep navigating back and forth between pages, and this weird bubble interface only shows 4 choices at a time on a big iPhone 6 screen. Much less efficient.What is so bad about scrollable lists? Why does everyone feel the need to invent some kind of worse interface idea than the obvious?",1.8,Philips Hue,J0047,2,1,"You can't remote access anymore, group lights to the same color and the dimming feature is visually nice, but annoying to use on a frequent basis. Thank you for letting us use gen 1 still.",1.8,Philips Hue,Rockwall Flyer,2,3,"I really like the new interface and controls; however, there are some bugs in the app. I cannot add more than four rooms because it says I have no lights in the 5th room and wants to delete all of the scenes I have set up. The wake up routine did not run at the assigned time and only turned on two of three bulbs assigned to room in the routine.

The implementation of ""rooms"" that are stored in bridge memory is excellent, leaps and bounds ahead of the ""scene sharing"" in the old version. The 'no frills' minimalistic approach to the UI is much appreciated and is slightly more tasteful in my humble opinion. One problem I have encountered is the constant disconnecting from the bridge only if I sign into my hue account, but since there's no real incentive to do that now, it's not a deal breaker. The reason why it isn't 5 star is because nothing really 'wowed' me. More of the same (which isn't a bad thing).

I'm going to jump straight in so the developers can address the issues quickly and easily:WHAT'S RIGHT:- A sleek, more modern design that was sorely needed.- The app is quick.- You have on/off switches for lights right on the homepage. - That's it.WHAT'S WRONG:- WHY ARE YOU STILL FORCING THESE ""PICTURE"" SCENES? No one wants them! Let us just create our own scenes, not using photos! It doesn't even make sense to use photos! No one else is seeing the photos, so all they see is the lights change to random colours. I'm sure most people also only have one light in a room, so WHY would I want to use a photo?! - Where has the iPad and Apple Watch support gone? I have both an iPad Pro and Apple Watch, why remove loved functionality? - When creating a widget I have 3 options to pick from, none of which I can find a way to customise?!?! This is the MOST annoying thing for me. And again it involves the stupid use of photo scenes! If there is a way to customise these, make it easier to find, or better yet, put a ""Make your own scene"" button right there! So we can tap that, go through the nice menus of choosing the ""rooms"", and then let US configure the colour, brightness. I don't want your tropical pictures or savanna or whatever other stupid photos you choose. I want my own colours. I want my own scenes. I think that sums it up. There's so much done right with this, I think the reason I'm annoyed is because there are also so many obvious oversights! Please fix these. And please make things easy to use.

Warum man hier aber zur eigenen Schande eine gerade mal das alpha-stadium berwundene App ver_ffentlicht hat, erschliet sich mir nicht unbedingt.

Update is good but I look forward to more features. My only wish is for Philips to create dynamic scenes. For example I love the preloaded dynamic scenes for the Philips go lamp and wish these were available for my other bulbs.,1.8,Philips Hue,Only4You,2,2,"So for me a lot of the older interface worked fine. And if I wanted to I could easily pick and choose lights and put them all into the same color so that they would match. With this version of Philips hue you can't. I'm also a user who has a large amount of hue bulbs that are spread across my house many of them are in fixtures with multiple sockets like chandeliers. It's was a common thing for me to change the color all at once and now I can't do that and it drives me up the wall because the colors don't match. The regression of scene creation has got to be fixed. There is no way that I want to use a picture and not beanie to see on the picture where I'm getting the color from. That's the point of me using my own photos. So that I can chose the exact color from that photo that I wanted. Also the loss of scenes from my old app to the new one was kind of a killer. When you have to rebuild all of the scenes you've had before into the new app I can be time consuming.

Then with the integration with IFTTT, there were possibilities that were never available to before. I was excited to hear of the 2nd gen hue app with new possibilities. Those new possibilities are ""HEADACHES"".Headaches:1.) Scenes are not or cannot be imported from the hue 1st gen account. We now have to REBUILD ALL 1st gen scenes from scratch. Deal breaker for me. 2.) No iPad support, REALLY? My iPad Mini is my home control device; not my iPhone in the bedroom charging. Support for both is a MUST.3.) Reduction in functionality. Pros:1.) Nice UI for light color and intensity. Staying with hue 1st gen for now.",1.8,Philips Hue,RayP64,2,1,"You don't have the ""alarms & timers the first app had so you can't set the lights to go on or off when you're not home at a specific time, only when you leave or arrive.

Unfortunately the widget regresses in features: there is no more ""second tap on a widget turns your lights off"", so I have to take up valuable widget space with a dedicated Off button again, which is totally lame.Otherwise I am perfectly happy with the new app, works just fine for my purposes. I'll admit that it confused me at first, HUE would benefit quite a bit from including a video tutorial or something. I am not sure why more apps don't include introductory tutorials or videos to show you the basics of app usage first. Most users are not as smart or as patient as I am. I could imagine an average Joe or Joey getting really frustrated trying to adapt to the new app.Edit: some reviews here are perplexing. One user says ""I need bulbs that can be in multiple rooms"".

Scenes don't seem to save correctly, if I set up a ""relax"" scene with lights dimmed to 25% percent and then activate it with Siri the lights come on at 100%. Baffling. Further more you cannot set up mixed scenes, a feature which would have been a vast improvement.

Anche le attivit sono limitate: si pu interagire con solo 4 stanze. Al momento per me non  un problema, ma pensiamo a chi ha investito in tutta la casa...Creare una scena da una foto non permette di personalizzare le luci. Creare una scena da una personalizzazione di luci non permette di assegnare un'immagine alla scena. Verificare se le lampade sono offline  macchinoso.

Worst of all, loses all settings from before. Terrible.",1.8,Philips Hue,Giving_You_FLAC,2,2,"How badly they messed this up; let me count (some of) the ways...1.) Seriously, no native iPad support? What? It's 2016, are you joking? This is an expensive product.2.) Why the heck did you make us sign into our account to share scenes on gen 1, but now I can't even import those scenes to gen 2? Terrible.3.) How could you make the widget this much worse? The icons take up too much space, and you can't even tap it again to turn the scene off! WHAT?! So now I need a second widget button for EVERY scene in order to turn off a scene or room? Just an awful step back in ease of use.4.) Where are the custom picture scenes? Either it's gone (boo) or I can't find it, which is even worse.5.) Why have the useless ""more"" tab at the main screen if you're still going to use a stupid hamburger menu (with a settings icon) to access important settings???6.) Siri voice control is still very hit or miss. ""Sorry I couldn't find any lights"" or similar is a frequent failure, and yet the action still works sometimes despite Siri saying it failed. That's the main reason I bought a new Bridge and it's the least reliable aspect. Huge disappointment.7.) Routines seem cool, but what if I take a day off and want to not have the lights wake me up? There should be a snooze or day off button that skips the next wake up. Reconfiguring routines for one day, then having to remember to change it back is too many steps. Solve this with Calendar integration perhaps?I honestly could go on and on, I'm incredibly disappointed in this new app. Hire a proper development team and/or give the existing one the freedom and resources needed to do their job properly. Someone who can lead with a vision of intuitive usability needs to tear this app to the ground and start over. Again.Every Hue owner I know says the same thing- the product is amazing but the app is just terrible.  Most 3rd party apps are so much more functional and intuitive than the official app, which is just sad.This update makes baby steps to improving some things, while taking giant leaps back on others. I'll stick to the gen 1 app until this is more useable.",1.8,Philips Hue,Putz26,2,1,"I'm not understanding the direction they are going at all.  What is the point of 2 apps that don't work the same? Why wouldn't you take the features from gen 1 and port them over to the design of gen 2?  No grouping, way less control by having it choose the colors from a photo without your opinion, huge bubbles force you to scroll constantly to find scenes.  Astonishingly bad.  Speaking in total honesty, if this was the default app (doing away with gen 1), I would sell my lights.  Doesn't having all your scenes, settings, and features in one place make sense?  I sure hope so, Philips.",1.8,Philips Hue,SteamyDinkins,2,1,"This new app looks much better than 1.0, but it has a baffling lack of core functionality.1) You can't adjust the color of multiple lights at the same time. So if you have 3 or 4 in a room, you have to adjust them one at a time and just get as close to the same color a you can.2) It isn't universal like 1.0. If you use it on an iPad it's just a blown up iPhone app, which looks bad and is hard to use due to the goofy iPhone keyboard.3) All of my scenes from 1.0 are gone.File this one under ""Did anyone who worked on this actually use it in their homes?"" and go back to 1.0, which had UI problems but at least gives you sensible controls and runs on the iPad.",1.8,Philips Hue,alx1196,2,2,"I do like the room separation, but you need to bring back Scenes as a section.

Scenes only have shuffle, no individual light control over the photo. 3. Editing a scene crops my photo again and again, shrinking it a bit each time. 4. Sunrise alarm is just one color. Come on Philips!! You invented the sunrise alarm, why can't you just create a simple red-orange-yellow pattern instead of just dimming.and where did the fade timer go for the opposite direction?This seems like a junior iOS dev did that, with the worst QA ever.",1.8,Philips Hue,Carmella B'Nachala,2,5,"This is an improvement. Simpler, cleaner interface that enables me to do the things I do most (turn on/off and adjust brightness) faster!

If you tap into say your Living Room, you will see the list of your lights. Tap each light icon to choose its color, and then at the bottom you will see a ""+"" symbol. Tap that, and you can save your creation. Do not create a scene with a photo on the Scenes page, it's useless!*This is a poor update to the previous app. While visually it is nicer to look at, it loses a lot of functionality.The idea of Rooms is nice, but you could create the same thing in the gen 1 app by making scenes, and with proper naming Siri could control them.I also don't understand why you can't change the color of a Room all at once without using a Scene. You have to go into each light individually to change color. Good luck matching them all.  What is the point of Rooms again?The scene creator is a mess. You have no control over what color individual lights will be, it is completely random.It now takes multiple taps to get to the change scene page, when before it took one.Routines (timers) STILL do not have an off time, so the user has to create two separate Routines instead of making one and setting it to turn off in 3 hours.I could go on. They focused on graphics instead of improving functionality. You are actually getting less with this new app, and things they should have added are not here.",1.8,Philips Hue,pilot76103,2,2,"I love the Philips Hue system and have had everything setup very well in my Gen 1 app however I tried this Gen 2 app and while I like the introduction of rooms I should be able to assign lights to multiple rooms for easier use. For example I would like a separate room for just my breakfast bar and living room but would like a ""family room"" that turns both on. Easily accomplished in gen 1 but when adding the lights to a new room they get removed from the other rooms.",1.8,Philips Hue,DaxtonW,2,4,"I really do like the new app. It feels much more intuitive and my lights seem to be more responsive. Routines are much better than the timers before but the way things are grouped by room makes it inconvenient if you only want one light to come on when you wake up. You have to put the light you want in a room by itself.The way it's divided by rooms is decent for general control but it means that if you have lights you only use as accents sometimes and not just as every day lighting (for example, I have a couple main lights for my living room but also a tv accent lamp and a custom fixture I made) then when you set them to come on when you arrive home it turns on ALL the lights and not just the main ones I use. This is fixed by, again, putting the main lights in their own room, which is fine, but inconvenient. The biggest downside is the scenes feature but I never used it much anyways. I do hate that I can't choose lights and colors individually for alarms though. You're stuck with presets/scenes which are pointless if you are only using one light for your wake up alarm. I did switch over to the new app from the old one though so all in all this new version is an improvement but there are still some kinks for me, personally.",1.8,Philips Hue,JChumney,2,4,"I like the changes a lot.

That wasn't a well thought out change. When I wake up, I don't expect my wife's bedside light to turn on in the same bedroom.

I also have Lutron Caseta, and SIRI conflicts with naming conventions are a pain.",1.8,Philips Hue,Wolftag,2,1,"I think this was an attempt to better integrate with HomeKit's concept of rooms.  But it isn't worth giving up so many other features like picking the color of each bulb in a scene (it's random now).  I also would like to sometimes control more than one room at a time, such as a ""nightlight"" scene that sets some bulbs in each room to dim red.  No go now.  The support for switches seems to have regressed too.  On top of all that, my Siri voice control isn't working at all.  It doesn't seem actually understand any of the room names.  It seems like old names from the gen 1 app are interfering.  The gen 1 and gen 2 apps need to be merged.

Plus the emphasis on photo-based colors (mostly a novelty at best) is still there. And in case you want to have multiple bulbs in one room with the same color, good luck getting all of them to match correctly, the method for choosing color is even worse. But at least it's easier now to gauge their intensity. Overall, Philips once again demonstrates a knack for excellent hardware and absolutely terrible (and clueless) software.",1.8,Philips Hue,Ddach431,2,1,"So all my old scenes are gone. Fine. Annoying and unnecessary but fine. Scene sharing is apparently gone so now everyone in the house needs to reconfigure from scratch great. No more Apple Watch app, huh.

Isn't that the whole point?

It groups lights into rooms, which reduces the need for numerous scenes. If you have Hue, you need this upgrade.",1.8,Philips Hue,notactuallyrelevant,2,5,Finally the Hue app considered user experience. After setting the bridge up its just a breeze to control all the lights.,1.8,Philips Hue,papaporro,2,3,"I just downloaded the app, and it is designed for the iPhone.

Satrop,2,1,"OK, allow me to start with the update looks fantastic! That was a very welcome upgrade. Now for the not so good. Light recipes, where did they go? Looked high and low and I can't find them. The lack of being able to individually pic a lightbulb and select the color I want when making a new picture recipe 100% killed this version for me. It makes NO sense not to have this function. I'll sit back and wait for that feature to be added back in.",1.8,Philips Hue,Aebloomfield,2,2,I don't like how you can't set scenes to be a certain brightness by default.

Why can't I select my own colors for the Gen 2 scenes? Why do I have to put a single bulb into a room just to be able to use half the functions? Where is the iPad scaling? There are good bits here, much of the UI is easier to use and understand.",1.8,Philips Hue,gaack,2,1,"It's great they are trying to improve and the interface itself is better. However, a couple of big fails here I am sure they anticipated people complaining about. #1: room based control. So now a scene can only control lights assigned to a specific room. See point #2. #2: No easy way to port over my gen 1 scenes. Even if I did as they recommend, use gen 1 to activate scene and they save current set up in gen 2, most of my scenes won't fully work because of point #1. My living room is connected to my dining room, hallway and loft. #3: Selecting lights based off a picture and being able to move the points around and group them is gone. That was the best feature gen 1 had. It was the one cool that I showed everyone as a brand enthusiast. It was so intuitive, easy and fast. Now, it's random and clunky to adjust if you want to change individual lights after starting with a picture. It doesn't even make sense in gen 2. Yes, I can still use gen 1, as long as it's there and supported. But we always want to use the shiny new thing.The best thing about gen 2 is multiple bridge support.",1.8,Philips Hue,kennykolour,2,3,Much needed update I like all the improvements EXCEPT the app for Apple Watch was dropped in this update...big loss for me. Other than that I would have given it 5 stars if it was included.,1.8,Philips Hue,Cls.NWChi,2,1,"What a mess, everything from assigning lights to rooms, to creating scenes is a nightmare.First off, you need to assign bulbs to rooms, and only one room per bulb. This leads to having to hit multiple buttons to adjust more than room. Annoying, but even worst, choosing a scene randomly assigns bulbs a color from that photo, there is no way to adjust lights individually in a scene.Not sure what they were thinking with this app, stick to the gen 1 version or a third party app.",1.8,Philips Hue,iklier,2,2,"While I appreciate that you are attempting to create a better experience compared to the train wreck of a gen1 app; dropping device support out of the gate doesn't inspire much confidence. Please add support for iPad (including the iPad Pro) and iOS 9 multitasking.",1.8,Philips Hue,explorz,2,1,"There is no button dedicated to scenes. That is one of the primary things I go to in my app. In order to get to a scene I have to click on rooms, then click again into a specific room, and then click again into the scenes that are set up only for that room.It seems scenes cannot incorporate lights from other rooms? This is ridiculous. Editing scenes is a nightmare. I can find no way to add or manipulate lights in a scene. Nor can I change the picture associated with a scene. This app is buggy and badly designed. So I decided to delete a scene I had created, and trying to do so fails.  At least Phillips Hue has been consistent in delivering ridiculously ill-conceived lighting solutions.",1.8,Philips Hue,interjonas,2,4,This update is excellent over the old app. However where is the Apple Watch app? Please include it soon.,1.8,Philips Hue,iruletheworld123,2,2,"I love the new design of the app and some of the new features like setting up rooms and easier to use location routines but when this app was released they left out the ability to group your lights together to match a single color when creating a scene. Now when I create a scene my lights don't match the exact same color. Also, I hate sliders. Yeah, they're visually appealing but I prefer accuracy over aesthetics. Either the beta-testers didn't give them good feedback or Phillips dropped the ball here...",1.8,Philips Hue,NickFro,2,3,"This is a good start, but we need the Apple Watch app back as well as actual iPad support (as in the gen 1 app). Third parties will fill the void if Philips can't or won't, however.",1.8,Philips Hue,jake-zilla,2,4,"This app needs some modifications to make it perfect. With that said, there's a lot of good going on here, and I'm really pleased that we're getting a major update to the app. First, the Siri controls feel unnatural, and have to be said out very specifically. I want to be able to just tell Siri ""turn off my bedroom lights"" and that's it; done. The new scene arrangement is interesting, but I can't seem to manually assign colors to lights when I import a photo. Maybe I've just not figured it out, but it doesn't appear to be there. I don't like that I can't edit the relax and bright scenes, or create new ones. I have the old app programmed to go from full bright light to full orange light every even after sundown. There's a lot of good here though. The added room separation is great. It's much nicer to look at now. Overall, pretty happy with the direction this app is going.",1.8,Philips Hue,ccrosby94,2,5,This new app is so much better compared to the previous version (gen 1). I love the fact that we now have rooms - a desperately needed feature that was available in other third party apps. Siri now correctly works for HomeKit functionality. Overall a fantastic update and cannot wait to see additional features added.,1.8,Philips Hue,Drmm3r01,2,5,This app is significantly better than before. Love how you can now set up lights based on rooms and how there is a master control switch at the top. Definitely makes it easier to use!,1.8,Philips Hue,Kollik,2,1,I was excited to see that after years of development Philips finally added the support for multiple bridges. Alas short lived happiness as you can't access rooms on different bridges without switching bridges. Seriously Philips... Get a clue!!!,1.8,Philips Hue,sfobaer,2,1,"In the previous version of hue you could open a picture, and from that picture assign color values to your hue lights. In this reinterpretation of the scene feature you select an image as before, but the app then randomly assigns colors from the image to your lights. Want two lights to share the same color? Sorry, not going to happen. Apparently there is no migration of your scenes through the website either. Youre starting from scratch with this version, configuring all your lights. Its a re-imagination of hue, and if youre a new customer, Im sure its just fine. But some consideration of existing users and their habits would have been nice.",1.8,Philips Hue,jbanning,2,5,Loving the new version. Huge improvement!

I was hoping for an improved one with complications... Also the only way to have one tap scenes for all rooms is to use widgets.,1.8,Philips Hue,iNexxFear,2,3,"I like the addition of rooms but rooms control all lights not segments.  Need to figure that out, and how your rooms store on the hub, no need to reconfigure per device.  I still need to play with scenes and settings and how they relate to rooms.  The place to find where you login to your hue account is hidden, look under more not the settings.Loading this onto your iPad is a zoomed in phone format.  Not really designed for the larger iPad screen area which I feel is a flaw and draw back since Gen 1 was indeed designed for the two.Overall there's improvements and its t the spot where it would compete back with competitor apps and layouts. Just hoping for a few more refinements on this Gen 2 to help the stragglers and things Iike the iPad since there much more scrolling due to the zoom in and you can see it a across the room as opposed to smaller items and fitting more on the screen (meaning iPhone size switches on the larger screen, not 10x zoom)",1.8,Philips Hue,Insomniac86,2,1,The old version has iPad and Apple Watch support. This has neither. Thanks for the down grade!,1.8,Philips Hue,SickDmith,2,1,Serious feature cut - new scenes is a joke.,1.8,Philips Hue,TrianglePie,2,2,"Although the app looks better, it has lost some of the best features in the old application. First of all, where is an IPAD APP?  The application no longer has the ability to change functions of scenes. Where in the old app you could choose individual lights change the colour & brightness this feature has been stripped in the new app. One of the best features about the old app was in the widgets, turning a scene on and a OFF function was shown, making functionality easier without opening the app every time you want to make a change to the lights. The app is now slow and has crashed several times. The ""room"" function limits the ability to individualise lights and scenes. I am extremely disappointed with this update to the app, what was a really good opportunity to reformat the existing app and add extra functionality the system is now slowed & functions reduced. I have a few suggestions, apart from bringing back personalisation of scenes, to have the ability to create a floorpan of your house where you can map lights and make changes. Would not recommend the update... Time to step it up Philips.",1.8,Philips Hue,StephanD88,2,3,"I just love the new design of the Hue app. It's beautiful. But on the opposite, it has lost functions from the previous app. - transitions can only be done with 5 minutes or higher, in the old app you could use 1 minute- the new 'rooms' function is nice, but I can't create a scene with mutiple rooms included, or I have to make the app 'think' some bulbs are in some certain rooms. There just must be an option for multiple room scenes!- when creating a scene with a picture, you can only shuffle colors, but I can't tap the picture to choose the picture's color for a certain bulb anymore. The shuffle is nice, but the old option must return!",1.8,Philips Hue,Jedachtdatjevanmijafwas,2,1,Helaas ontbreekt in deze 2e generatie Hue app de mogelijkheid om bijvoorbeeld 1 lamp in te stellen als een anti inbraak tijdschakelaar die willekeurig aan en uit gaat.

I cannot really find any new functions, and I actually have the feeling that the new app has less functions. It feels very complicated, and I am not able to make scenes using individual lights in multiple rooms. That's an option we really need in the new app, as this was already possible in the old one!I might get used to it, but overall I'm a little disappointed and I will continue using huemote as that app has still a lot more functions and works a lot easier than the hue gen 2 app. I'm sorry Philips but the new app is apart from the new looks a bit of a letdown.",1.8,Philips Hue,Wiebsel,2,3,"Lampen sorteren op kamers is prettig, uitgelijk van de app ook.

Generation ist sehr gut. Ich finde es klasse Zimmer anlegen zu k_nnen.Dadurch ist die Bediengung ber Siri deutlich verbessert. Das Design ist deutlich moderne und intuitiver (wobei hier sicherlich auch noch  etwas zu tun w_re). Leider vermisse ich ein paar Dinge (nicht nach Wichtigkeit geordnet):1. Geofencing fr mehrere User. Was ntzt mir die Funktion, wenn ich das Haus verlasse und meine Frau im dunkeln sitzt? Oder ich nach Hause komme und eine zuvor, von meiner Frau, eingestellte Szene sich pl_tzlich _ndert? Eine L_sung hierfr h_tte ich auch nicht parat, aber ich wrde sie sehr begren. 2. Dynamische Szenen. Ich finde die Funktion innerhalb der Hue Labs sehr gut und sch_n. Bitte bringen Sie sie in die App. 3. Eine zus_tzliche Sektion, in der man ""Zeitschaltuhren"" einstellen kann. - das funktioniert auch unter ""Routinen"", aber dadurch w_re die App aufger_umter. Ich sch_tze viele nutzen die Lampen als Zeitschaltuhren, wenn man z.B. im Urlaub ist. 4. Szenen _ndern - wie frher! Ich m_chte einzelnen Lampen gewisse Farben zuweisen. Nicht, dass dies automatisch anhand des Bildes geschieht. Ich wei besser, wo meine Lampen stehen.5. Einzelne Lampen ansteuern. Fr meine Nachttischlampe msste ich einen extra Raum anfertigen, damit nur diese Lampe aktiviert wird, wenn ich z.B. lesen m_chte. So ist mein Schlafzimmer hell erleuchtet. Hier reicht mir eine Lampe und nicht alle Hue Birnen im Zimmer. Ein extra Raum ""Nachttisch Lampe"" sehe ich als Notl_sung an. 6. Meine Hue Go mag ich ebenfalls keinen Raum zuweisen.
